benson boone - beautiful things
For a while there it was rough
But lately I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers I recall
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She'll come and stay the night and I think I might have it all
And I thank God every day
For the girl He sent my way
But I know the things He gives me He can take away
And I hold you every night
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you




Oh I hope I don't losе you
Mm please stay
I want you I need you oh God
Don't take
Thеse beautiful things that I've got

If everything's good and it's great why do I sit and wait 'til it's gone?
Oh I'll tell ya I know I've got enough
I've got peace and I've got love
But I'm up at night thinkin' I just might lose it all


Please stay
I want you I need you oh God

Euphoria
Them super powers gettin' neutralized I can only watch in silence
The famous actor we once knew is lookin' paranoid and now is spiralin'
You're movin' just like a degenerate every antic is feelin' distasteful
I calculate you're not as calculated I can even predict your angle
Fabricatin' stories on the family front 'cause you heard Mr. Morale
A pathetic master manipulator I can smell the tales on you now
You'rе not a rap artist you a scam artist with the hopes of being accеpted
Tommy Hilfiger stood out but FUBU never had been your collection
I make music that electrify 'em you make music that pacify 'em
I can double down on that line but spare you this time that's random acts of kindness
Know you a master manipulator and habitual liar too
But don't tell no lie about me and I won't tell truths 'bout you

Oh you thought the money the power or fame would make you go away?
Have you ever played have-you-ever? Okay nigga let's play
Have you ever walked your enemy down like with a poker face?
Have you ever paid five hundred thou' like to an open case?
Well I have and I failed at both but I came out straight
I hate when a rapper talk about guns then somebody die they turn into nuns
Then hop online like Pray for my city he fakin' for likes and digital hugs
His daddy a killer he wanna be junior they must've forgot the shit that they done
Dementia must run in his family but let it get shaky
I'll park his son

I didn't point down enough today I'll show you I learned from those mistakes
Somebody had told me that you got a ring on God I'm ready to double the wage
I'd rather do that than let a Canadian nigga make Pac turn in his grave
Cutthroat business you got shit twisted

We ain't gotta get personal this a friendly fade you should keep it that way
I know some shit about niggas that make Gunna Wunna look like a saint
This ain't been about critics not about gimmicks not about who the greatest
It's always been about love and hate now let me say I'm the biggest hater
I hate the way that you walk the way that you talk I hate the way that you dress
I hate the way that you sneak diss if I catch flight it's gon' be direct
We hate the bitches you fuck 'cause they confuse themself with real women
And notice I said we it's not just me I'm what the culture feelin'
How many more fairytale stories 'bout your life 'til we had enough?
How many more Black features 'til you finally feel that you're Black enough?
I like Drake with the melodies I don't like Drake when he act tough
You gon' make a nigga bring back Puff let me see if Chubbs really crash somethin'
Yeah my first one like my last one it's a classic you don't have one
Let your core audience stomach that then tell 'em where you get your abs from
V12 it's a fast one baow-baow-baow last one
Headshot for the year you better walk around like Daft Punk

Extortion my middle name as soon as you jump off of that plane bitch
I'm allergic to the lame shit only you like bein' famous
Yachty can't give you no swag neither I don't give a fuck 'bout who you hang with
I hate the way that you walk the way that you talk I hate the way that you dress
Surprised you wanted that feature request you know that we got some shit to address
I even hate when you say the word nigga but that's just me I guess
Some shit just cringeworthy it ain't even gotta be deep I guess
Still love when you see success everything with me is blessed
Keep makin' me dance wavin' my hand and it won't be no threat
I'm knowin' they call you The Boy but where is a man? 'Cause I ain't seen him yet
Matter fact I ain't even bleed him yet can I bleed him? (Bet)
When I see you stand by Sexyy Red I believe you see two bad bitches
I believe you don't like women it's real competition you might pop ass with 'em
Let's speak on percentage show me your splits I'll make sure I double back with ya
You were signed to a nigga that's signed to a nigga that said he was signed to that nigga
Try cease and desist on the Like That record?
Ho what? You ain't like that record?
Back To Back I like that record
I'ma get back to that for the record
Why would I call around tryna get dirt on niggas? Y'all think all my life is rap?
That's ho shit I got a son to raise but I can see you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Wakin' him up know nothin' 'bout that
Then tell him to pray know nothin' 'bout that
Then givin' him tools to walk through life like day by day know nothin' 'bout that
Teachin' him morals integrity discipline listen man you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Speakin' the truth and consider what God's considerin' you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Ain't twenty-v-one it's one-v-twenty if I gotta smack niggas that write with you

Tell 'em run to America to imitate heritage they can't imitate this violence
What I learned is niggas don't like the West Coast and I'm fine with it I'll push the line with it
Pick a nigga off one at a time with it
We can be on a three-hour time difference
Don't speak on the family crodie
It can get deep in the family crodie
Talk about me and my family crodie?
Someone gon' bleed in your family crodie

I Remember everything - Zach Brayn


Rotgut whiskey's gonna ease my mind
Beach towel rests on the dryin' line
Do I remind you of your daddy in his '88 Ford?
Labrador hangin' out the passenger door
The sand from your hair is blowin' in my eyes
Blame it on the beach grown men don't cry
Do you remember that beat-down basement couch?
I'd sing you my love songs and you'd tell me about
How your mama ran off and pawned her ring
I remember I remember everything


A cold shoulder at closing time
You were bеggin' me to stay 'til the sun rose
Strangе words come on out
Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke
Pictures and passin' time
You only smile like that when you're drinkin'
I wish I didn't but I do
Remember every moment on the nights with you

To any bitch that talk to him and they in love

And Party at the party playin' with his nose now
And Baka got a weird case why is he around?
Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles
Wop wop wop wop wop Dot fuck 'em up

Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy what?)
Quavo said you can be from Northside (What?)
2 Chainz say you good but he lied
You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars

Pink Skies - Zach Brayn
The kids are in town for a funeral
So pack the car and dry your eyes
I know they got plenty of young blood left in 'em
And plenty nights under pink skies you taught 'em to enjoy


So clean the house clear the drawers mop the floors stand tall
Like no one's ever been here before or at all
And don't you mention all the inches that are scraped on the doorframe
We all know you tiptoed up to 4'1 back in '08


If you could see 'em now you'd be proud
But you'd think they's yuppiеs
Your funeral was beautiful
I bet God hеard you comin'
 
The kids are in town for a funeral
And the grass all smells the same as the day you broke your arm swingin'
On that kid out on the river
You bailed him out never said a thing about Jesus or the way he's livin'


If you could see 'em now you'd be proud
But you'd think they's yuppies
Your funeral was beautiful
I bet God heard you comin'
(Strum it)

Something In The Orange - Zach Brayn 
It'll be fine by dusk light I'm tellin' you baby
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much but there's no weight at all
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done


To you I'm just a man; to me you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home


I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancin' this wood used to creak
To you I'm just a man; to me you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home
To you I'm just a man; to me you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home
If you leave today I'll just stare at the way
The orange touches all things around
The grass trees and dew how I just hate you
Please turn those headlights around
Please turn those headlights around






Stick Season - Noah Kahan
As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined
You must've had yourself a change of heart like halfway through the drive
Because your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign
Kept on drivin' straight and left our future to the right
Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face
And memories are somethin' even smoking weed does not replace
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains
Doc told me to travel but there's Covid on the planes




And I love Vermont but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half but that'll have to do


 
So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad
That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from Dad
No I am no longer funny 'cause I miss the way you laugh
You once called me forever now you still can't call me back


And I love Vermont but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault but I just like to play the victim

That I might not have but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half but that'll have to do


Oh that'll have to do
My other half was you
I hope this pain's just passin' through
But I doubt it


And I love Vermont but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half but that'll have to do
Have to do

Too Sweet - Hozier
It can't be said I'm an early bird
It's 10 o'clock before I say a word
Baby I can never tell
How do you sleep so well?
You keep tellin' me to live right
To go to bed before the daylight
But then you wake up for the sunrise
You know you don't gotta pretend
Baby now and then


Don't you just wanna wake up dark as a lake
Smellin' like a bonfire lost in a haze?
If you're drunk on life babe I think it's great
But while in this world


I think I'll take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskеy neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for mе
You're too sweet for me
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
 
I aim low
I aim true and the ground's where I go
I work late where I'm free from the phone
And the job gets done
But you worry some I know
But who wants to live forever babe?
You treat your mouth as if it's Heaven's gate
The rest of you like you're the TSA
I wish I could go along
Babe don't get me wrong


You know you're bright as the morning as soft as the rain
Pretty as a vine as sweet as a grape
If you can sit in a barrel maybe I'll wait
Until that day


I'd rather take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me


Woah woah
Woah woah
Woah woah
Woah woah


I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me

I don't need a trophy
I am the trophy I be telling niggas
Yo


 
There's a story behind that name when they call me the Pyrex Man
Like them two bricks from Doug and poppies from Kazakhstan
I never sold meth but I know fent' a thousand yams
You ODin' off this shit if you bag and don't wash your hands
Me teary-eyed and gullible I lived it with a mother
Who strugglеd through addiction I know every side to drug abusе
'Fore life got this comfortable it's been a few niggas
Who still in they same position because our bond indestructible
It go both ways auntie spent a thirty on that rock
And the nigga who served her owe a plug who thirsty for that knot
The dealer who fronted that birdie he murdered for that guap
That was me but now I'm currently trading currency for stocks
I'm Wall Street-butchering I'm getting thirty percent off top
Forty percent get chopped other thirty? Back in the pot
Ask these rappers shit I did for upstate just helped make 'em hot
When I invite 'em to the lab they be scared to play what they got
I'm the don of all dons YSL and Bond No. 9
Living proof sign of the times that hate won't bother your grind
I feel like West' on Gustavo the cocky confident side
You look a killer in their face 'cause they say their eyes still don't lie
I'm hearing rumors start to fly that we split the triangle nah
Any talks of that's maniacal but y'all buy it though why?
I'm still that same hustler fresh out the Ps that sign on the spot
I guess I stepped on a few rappers on my climb to the top
Who sliding? Invited or not the violence won't stop
We on that same time and them irons gon' cock then them sliding doors pop
My niggas catch you at that light then light up your drop
It's like that the last opp we racked we united the block
Long roads to success they hearts broke when I step
They reminiscin' of me speakin' in morse code to connects
Me and my homies passport bros pilots load up the jets
Gulfstreams landing in time zones no one expects mm
Chip in on jet fuel the flight I slept through
I just need a shot of tequila and Bluetooth I can connect to
It's disrespectful to sit these niggas next to Butch
So I'm shitting around these pussies just like a all-gender restroom
Trips to Bahamas y'all talking shit from the comments
I'm somewhere off the coast smoking cartridges with my mama
It's Butch I did it solid turned visions to dollars
Seven-year run three away from that ten that I promised y'all
On One Way Flight brick rawer than Monday night
I always been the bigger fish y'all skinny pimps like Money Mike
Still no license running lights I let you pick—the gun or knife
Shay said there's no one as nice and that nigga was fucking right
So fuck you twice it's Butch

Sweet Dreams - Koe Wetzel 
A man like me would keep it to himself
A bigger man would say it to your face
Yeah I ain't doing good and you can tell
Was I the only one you couldn't save?
I hate to be the reason that you're crying
The way you always knew when I was lying
And breaking your heart was getting tiring
I knew I had to let you go


 
It's hard to have Sweet Dreams when I'm such a nightmare
I don't wanna talk about it rather not go there
When I find a good thing I burn it down slow
Only see your face now when my eyes are closed
It's so hard to have sweet dreams
Sweet dreams
It's so hard to have sweet dreams


 
I bet you're out living guilt free
The only thing you battle is your memory of me
Shit I ain't slept in weeks
Been trying everything from Ambien to THC


 
It's so hard to have Sweet Dreams when I'm such a nightmare
I don't wanna talk about it rather not go there
When I find a good thing I burn it down slow
Only see your face now when my eyes are closed
It's so hard to have sweet dreams
And I thought you should know that
I been getting no sleep
And I probably deserve that
When I find a good thing I burn it down slow
Only see your face now when my eyes are closed
It's so hard to have sweet dreams
Sweet dreams
It's so hard to have sweet dreams


The nights keep getting longer
And you're still in my head
So I turn on all the lights
And I wrote you this


 
It's so hard to have Sweet Dreams when I'm such a nightmare
I don't wanna talk about it rather not go there
When I find a good thing I burn it down slow
Only see your face now when my eyes are closed
It's so hard to have sweet dreams
And I thought you should know that
I been getting no sleep
And I probably deserve that
When I find a good thing I burn it down slow
Only see your face now when my eyes are closed
It's so hard to have sweet dreams
Sweet dreams
It's so hard to have sweet dreams
Sweet dreams

New condo say your name at the front you can stay if you want
It's been one of those nights one of those nights I ain't had in a minute
It's been a minute had to pop a shroom to recreate the feeling (Ooh yeah)
But it's never the same as the first time we did it
First time we did it
See upcoming R&B shows
 
But I'll let my guard down for you (For you)
Said I'll put my guard down for you
Said I'll be vulnerable
So you can break my heart if you want to (Oh)


 
She said Take your time what's the rush? (Take your time what's the rush?)
I said Baby I'm a dog I'm a mutt (Oh)
She said Take your time what's the rush? Oh (The rush)

If they spin make 'em wish that they never spinned
Most of these niggas is hoes they be telling it

Hatin' like I don't know that's really jealously
Knowing they mad that they no longer next to me

Luke Combs - Ain’t No Love in Oklahoma
I keep chasing that same old devil
Down the same old dead-end highway
Riding that storm running through my veins
Like a shot down tailspun airplane
Scared of nothing and I'm scared to death
I can't breathe and I catch my breath
But I keep chasing that same old devil
Down the same old dead-end highway


 
Ain't no love in Oklahoma
Just the whistle of a long black train
You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain


 
I got saved in the same Red River
The same Red River tryna drown me
It ain't knocking me down I'm standing my ground
With the whole world falling all around me
I keep running but I'm standing still
Pray for peace but I need thе thrill
So I keep chasing that same old devil
Down the samе old dead-end highway
Ain't no love in Oklahoma
Just the whistle of a long black train
You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain


 
Ain't no love in Oklahoma
Just the whistle of a long black train
You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain
Ain't no love in Oklahoma
Just the whistle of a long black train
You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain

Luke Combs - Fast Car
You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me myself I got nothin' to prove


 
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
Been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the bordеr and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to bе livin'


 
See my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for workin'
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said Somebody's gotta take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did


You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way


 
So I remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I I had a feeling that I belonged
I I had a feeling I could be someone be someone be someone


 
You got a fast car
We go cruisin' entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house live in the suburbs


 
So I remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I I had a feeling that I belonged
I I had a feeling I could be someone be someone be someone
 
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
I got no plans I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving


 
So I remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I I had a feeling that I belonged
I I had a feeling I could be someone be someone be someone




You got a fast car

Morgan Wallen - Last night 
Last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby baby something's tellin' me this ain't over yet


 
No way it was our last night I kissed your lips
Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips
Last bottle of Jack we split a fifth
Just talkin' 'bout life goin' sip for sip
Yeah you you know you love to fight
And I say shit I don't mean
But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me


 
I know that last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby baby something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)


 
No way it was the last night that we break up
I see your tail lights in the dust
You call your mama I call your bluff
In the middle of the night pull it right back up
Yeah my my friends say Let her go
Your friends say What the hell?
I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else
 
Oh baby last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby baby something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night we said we'd had enough
I can't remember everything we said but we said too much
I know you packed your shit and slammed the door right before you left
But baby baby something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)


 
I know you said this time you really weren't comin' back again
But baby baby something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)

On a goodbye ride but it's fine 'cause it's kinda my thing
Long live cowgirls

I hate that I love the way them kisses taste like whiskey
How they wake up take on off and not even miss me
Leave this heart broken holdin' that smokin' gun
I guess that's just the way them wild horses run
Let 'em run
Long live cowgirls
Never gonna settle on down girls
Leave you in a lonely ghost town world
Where the sun don't rise rodeo for one night
Love you like a mustang

Hole in your heart with some good aim
On a goodbye ride but it's fine 'cause it's kinda my thing
Long live cowgirls

Come on cowgirls
Don't you wanna take me away?
Lay me on down girl
With the wild kind of lovin' you make
For God's sake

Benson Boone - Slow It Down
I'd never met you but I wanted
To invite you to the party
Then you walked in with those green eyes
Never stolen by nobody
And they flicker to the future
For a moment I could picture
Then you touch me and I come back
And we're talking on the staircase
'Bout your big dreams on the big screens
Out of Georgia now you're lonely in this city
Lyin' with me
And you're scared it's movin' quickly
Oh now you're crying you're in pieces
'Cause the only love you've ever known is Jesus
I can feel it
Oh I hate that I'm the reason that you're


 
In your head right now
While your world is spinning out


 
So slow it down
Take a moment now
We're too young to drown
Deep in dirty waters
Full of hopeless doubt
Let me pull you out
Let me hold you now
Let me slow it down
Ain't it funny how it changes?
How the future rearranges
I get nervous oh I'm anxious
Maybe loving you is dangerous
I could lose you like the others
Only girl that's never left me is my mother
Oh I love her
And I know you'll probably hate it but I'm


 
In my head right now


 
So slow it down
Take a moment now
We're too young to drown
Deep in dirty waters
Full of hopeless doubt
Let me pull you out
Let me hold you now
Let me (Slow it down)


Slow it down
When you're on the ground
And you're crying
I'm trying (Slow it down)
To slow it down
When you're spinning 'round
In your head
 
(Ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh)
I'll help you slow it down

Tucker Wetmore - Wind up missin’ you
I know I might look like
Another ball cap on a bar stool
Underneath a PBR light
Sayin' everything under the moon
To get you into my arms tonight
You probably heard it all a thousand times
But it ain't what it looks like
Girl let me tell you what it looks like


 
You look like waves on a sunset
And you can crash on me all night
You look like wine in a truck bed
A little what I'm doin' for the rest of my life 'cause
You look like I'm done lookin'
But girl the hard truth is
If this night don't turn into two
You look like I'm gonna wind up missin' you


 
I gotta tell you baby I've been
The kind of boy your daddy never wanted
You to go and fall in love with
The kinda boys you're probably done with their dumb shit yeah
I bet you heard the stories and
Can't say I'm proud of that but
I've turned the page on the old me
And now I ain't lookin' back 'cause
You look like waves on a sunset
And you can crash on me all night
And you look like wine in a truck bed
A little what I'm doin' for the rest of my life 'cause
You look like I'm done lookin'
But girl the hard truth is
If this night don't turn into two
You look like I'm gonna wind up missin'


 
Missin' you in the mornin'
Probably for the next few years
When I look back on it
I'll still see you right here


 
You look like waves on a sunset
And you can crash on me all night
And you look like wine in a truck bed
A little what I'm doin' for the rest of my life 'cause
You look like I'm done lookin'
But girl the hard truth is
If this night don't turn into two
You look like I'm gonna wind up missin' you
 
Wind up missin' you
Wind up missin' you
