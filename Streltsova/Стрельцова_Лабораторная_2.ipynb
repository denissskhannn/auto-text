        "    \"A catastrophic failure in the Hydro-Quebec transmission system has triggered a cascading blackout affecting millions from Toronto to Boston. Officials report at least 12 fatalities linked to the outage, primarily from hospital equipment failures and traffic accidents. Emergency services are overwhelmed as cities enter a second night without power in sub-zero temperatures. The cause is under investigation, with initial data pointing to a cyber-attack on grid control systems. This is an unprecedented national security and humanitarian crisis, the Canadian Prime Minister stated.\",\n",
        "    \"The JT-60SA tokamak, a joint EU-Japan project, has successfully sustained a plasma reaction for 300 seconds while achieving a net energy gain (Q>1.2), a world record. Scientists hailed the milestone as the most concrete step yet toward viable commercial fusion power. The stable, long-duration pulse proves key containment technologies can work. This isn't just a scientific experiment anymore; it's an engineering blueprint, said the project lead. Global energy firms have already announced increased investment in fusion startups.\",\n",
        "    \"In a historic ceremony in Bogotá, the government and the National Liberation Army (ELN) signed a comprehensive peace agreement, formally ending a 60-year armed conflict. The deal includes cease-fire verification, guerrilla demobilization and reintegration, and rural development programs. UN officials praised the accord as a model for negotiated solutions. The last remaining armed group in Colombia is now set to transition into a political party, though challenges in implementation remain.\",\n",
        "    \"A farm worker in Argentina has been confirmed with a severe H5N1 infection, marking the first human case of a new clade of the virus that shows genetic markers for efficient mammalian transmission. The patient is in critical condition. While no human-to-human spread is confirmed, the WHO has raised its pandemic alert level and urged member states to review preparedness plans. The virus is changing; our vigilance must change faster, a WHO spokesperson warned.\",\n",
        "    \"The European Parliament has passed the AI Liability Directive, making developers and operators of high-risk AI systems legally liable for damages by default. The law covers everything from hiring algorithms to autonomous vehicles. Companies must now prove their AI was not at fault in cases of harm, reversing the traditional burden of proof. The tech industry warns this will stifle innovation, while consumer advocates call it a vital step for the digital age.\",\n",
        "    \"A cyber-attack on the Aadhaar database's backup servers has resulted in the theft of biometric data—including fingerprints and iris scans—linked to half a billion Indian identities. The government has confirmed the breach but downplayed risks, stating core encryption remains intact. Cybersecurity experts call it a digital catastrophe of generational scale, as biometric data is immutable. Fears of sophisticated identity fraud and state-level espionage are mounting.\",\n",
        "    \"The Kenyan government has declared a national disaster and deployed the military to coordinate logistics in northern regions where the UN has officially declared a famine. Five consecutive failed rainy seasons have decimated livestock and crops, displacing over 2 million people. Aid agencies accuse the government of a slow response, while corruption scandals plague the relief fund. We are witnessing a tragedy in slow motion, a regional UN coordinator stated.\",\n",
        "    \"State-run mining firm Korea Resources Corporation announced the discovery of a massive deposit of rare earth minerals, including dysprosium and neodymium, critical for EVs and high-tech weapons. Estimated to meet global demand for decades, the find in the Gangwon province could drastically shift supply chains away from China. Shares in Chinese rare earth firms plummeted on the news, while Korean tech conglomerates saw a sharp rally.\",\n",
        "    \"California has become the first U.S. state to legislate a right to disconnect, prohibiting employers from contacting staff outside of working hours except for genuine emergencies. The law, inspired by French and Portuguese models, fines companies for violations. It aims to combat burnout in the always-on work culture of the tech era. Business groups plan to challenge the law in court, arguing it undermines flexibility and global competitiveness.\",\n",
        "    \"Using LIDAR technology, an international team has mapped a vast, complex urban settlement in the Bolivian Amazon, dating to roughly 1500 years ago. The discovery features pyramids, canals, and agricultural networks supporting a population in the hundreds of thousands. It challenges the long-held view of the Amazon as a pristine wilderness with only small, nomadic tribes. This was a cradle of civilization we knew nothing about, the lead archaeologist said.\"\n",

Это состояние хронического стресса, вызванное необходимостью постоянно находиться в режиме многозадачности в цифровой среде, обрабатывать гигантские потоки информации и поддерживать виртуальное присутствие. Это больше, чем усталость от экрана; это глубокая апатия и чувство опустошённости, источник которых лежит в самой структуре нашего цифрового взаимодействия.  Корень проблемы — в стирании границ. Смартфон превратил дом в бесконечный офис, а время отдыха — в потенциальное рабочее время. Уведомления, чаты и бесконечные ленты социальных сетей создают когнитивную перегрузку, фрагментируя внимание и не давая мозгу возможности полноценно восстановиться. Мы испытываем давление необходимости быть в курсе событий, мгновенно реагировать и постоянно самопрезентоваться, что ведёт к перманентному состоянию низкоуровневой тревоги.  Симптомы выходят за рамки усталости глаз. К ним относятся снижение концентрации, парадоксальная неспособность справиться с простыми цифровыми задачами, цинизм и раздражительность, потеря мотивации, а также чувство неэффективности, несмотря на постоянную занятость. Страдает и физическое здоровье: нарушение сна из-за синего света экранов, головные боли и общее нервное напряжение.  Борьба с цифровым выгоранием требует сознательной цифровой гигиены. Ключевые стратегии включают в себя чёткое установление «цифровых границ» (например, отключение уведомлений после работы), практику «цифрового детокса» на регулярной основе, выделение времени для глубокой работы без переключений и осознанное потребление контента. Важно перестать рассматривать время offline как потерянное и признать его необходимость для творчества и эмоционального баланса. В конечном счёте, речь идёт о том, чтобы восстановить контроль над технологиями, перестав быть пассивными объектами их внимания-экономики, и начать использовать их как инструмент, а не как среду обитания.\"\"\"\n",

        "english_text = \"\"\"Beneath our feet lies a foundation of life that we are rapidly eroding. Soil degradation, the decline in soil quality caused by improper use, is a silent global crisis threatening food security, biodiversity, and climate stability. While less dramatic than melting glaciers, the loss of fertile topsoil is arguably just as consequential for humanity's future.  Modern industrial agriculture is a primary driver. Intensive tilling, monoculture cropping, and over-reliance on chemical fertilizers and pesticides disrupt the soil's delicate ecosystem. This destroys its structure, kills vital microorganisms, and strips it of organic matter. The result is soil that is less fertile, less able to retain water, and more prone to being washed or blown away. It is estimated that the world loses 24 billion tonnes of fertile soil annually, a rate far exceeding natural regeneration.  The consequences are profound. Degraded soil produces poorer yields, pushing farmers to clear more forests to maintain production, creating a vicious cycle. It also diminishes the soil's capacity to act as a carbon sink, releasing stored carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and exacerbating climate change. Furthermore, loss of topsoil leads to increased runoff and pollution of waterways with agricultural chemicals.  Solutions exist but require a paradigm shift. Regenerative agriculture practices, such as no-till farming, cover cropping, crop rotation, and integrated livestock management, work with nature to rebuild soil health. These methods enhance biodiversity, improve water infiltration, and sequester carbon. The challenge is scaling these practices globally, which demands policy changes, economic incentives for farmers, and consumer awareness. The health of our soil is not just an agricultural issue; it is a cornerstone of planetary survival, demanding immediate and concerted action to preserve this thin, vital skin of the Earth.\"\"\""

            "Beneath our feet lies a foundations of lives that we are rapidly eroding. Soils degradations, the declines in soils qualities caused by improper uses, is a silent global crises threatening foods securities, biodiversities, and climates stabilities. While less dramatic than melting glaciers, the losses of fertile topsoils is arguably just as consequential for humanities's futures.  Modern industrial agricultures is a primary drivers. Intensive tillings, monocultures croppings, and over-reliances on chemical fertilizers and pesticides disrupt the soils's delicate ecosystems. This destroys its structures, kills vital microorganisms, and strips it of organic matters. The results is soils that is less fertile, less able to retain waters, and more prone to being washed or blown away. It is estimated that the worlds loses 24 billion tonnes of fertile soils annually, a rates far exceeding natural regenerations.  The consequences are profound. Degraded soils produces poorer yields, pushing farmers to clear more forests to maintain productions, creating a vicious cycles. It also diminishes the soils's capacities to act as a carbons sinks, releasing stored carbons dioxides into the atmospheres and exacerbating climates changes. Furthermore, losses of topsoils leads to increased runoffs and pollutions of waterways with agricultural chemicals.  Solutions exist but require a paradigms shifts. Regenerative agricultures practices, such as noes-till farmings, cover croppings, crops rotations, and integrated livestocks managements, work with natures to rebuild soils healths. These methods enhance biodiversities, improve waters infiltrations, and sequesters carbons. The challenges is scaling these practices globally, which demands policies changes, economic incentives for farmers, and consumers awarenesses. The healths of our soils is not just an agricultural issues; it is a cornerstones of planetary survivals, demanding immediate and concerted actions to preserve this thin, vital skins of the Earths.\n"
