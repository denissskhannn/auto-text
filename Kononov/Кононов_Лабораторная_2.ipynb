        "    \"At least 55 dead and hundreds missing after fire engulfs Hong Kong tower blocks. At least 55 people have been killed in a huge fire that engulfed multiple high-rise buildings in Hong Kong - the city's deadliest blaze in more than 70 years. Some residents remain trapped inside the buildings, with more than 270 people unaccounted for. Hundreds of firefighters have been tackling the blaze, which is now largely under control at all of the affected buildings at Wang Fuk Court. The housing complex had been undergoing extensive renovations when the fire began.\",\n",
        "    \"Hostage families confirm identities of three of four bodies handed over by Hamas. Israeli hostage families have confirmed the identities of three of four bodies handed over by Hamas in Gaza on Tuesday. The bodies of Tamir Nimrodi, 20, Eitan Levy, 53, and Uriel Baruch, 35, were part of the latest return, the Hostages Families Forum said. The fourth body does not match any of the known hostages, Israel said. So far seven hostages' bodies are confirmed to have been sent back from Gaza. Hamas has yet to return the other bodies as agreed under a ceasefire deal brokered by the US.\",\n",
        "    \"Palestinians celebrate return of detainees freed by Israel. Hundreds of freed Palestinian prisoners and detainees have been welcomed with tears and screams of joy as they were released by Israel to be reunited with their families in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. The release involved about 250 prisoners who had been convicted of crimes including murder and deadly attacks against Israelis - and about 1,700 detainees from Gaza who had been held by Israel without charge. As prisoners exited a Red Cross bus in Ramallah, many draped in traditional Keffiyeh scarves, they looked pale and gaunt, with some struggling to walk.\",\n",
        "    \"Trump says Israel and Hamas 'sign off' on first phase of Gaza peace plan. US President Donald Trump has announced that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first phase of a peace plan for Gaza. This means that ALL of the Hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace, Trump wrote on Truth Social. The announcement comes after three days of indirect talks in Egypt - mediated by officials from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and the US - aimed at bringing an end to the two-year conflict.\",\n",
        "    \"Key US and regional mediators join talks in push to end Gaza war. Top US envoys and regional figures are taking part in the third day of indirect talks between Israel and Hamas in Egypt on President Donald Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza. Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, arrived in Sharm el-Sheikh on Wednesday along with Qatar's prime minister and Turkey's intelligence chief for what is expected to be a key day indicating whether progress can be made. A senior Hamas official told the BBC it had shown the necessary positivity in the negotiations and submitted a list of the Palestinian prisoners it wanted Israel to release in exchange for the hostages held in Gaza.\",\n",
        "    \"Macron should step down early and call presidential vote, says his first PM. Emmanuel Macron should name a prime minister to push through a budget and then call early presidential elections to solve France's political crisis, his first prime minister has said. Édouard Philippe's comments come after France's third prime minister in a year, Sébastien Lecornu, resigned on Monday after his bid to form a government fell apart. Macron has asked him to make a last-ditch plan for stability by the end of Wednesday - but support for the French president appears to be waning even among his allies. \",\n",
        "    \"India wants to lure its best minds back from the US - but it won't be easy. US President Donald Trump's abrupt decision to hike H-1B visa fees to $100,000 has prompted policymakers in Delhi to woo skilled Indians back home. A bureaucrat, who works closely with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, recently said that the government was actively encouraging overseas Indians to return and contribute to nation-building. Yet, another member of the PM's economic advisory council told a media conclave that H-1B visas have always served the interests of the host nation, and so the hike in fee boded well for India's ability to attract global talent. The crux of these arguments is that the time is ripe for India to engineer a reverse brain drain and lure some of the world's most talented professionals in technology, medicine and other innovative industries, who'd left the country in the past 30 years, back to the homeland.\",\n",
        "    \"Sanctions reimposed on Iran 10 years after landmark nuclear deal. Sweeping UN economic and military sanctions have been reimposed on Iran - 10 years after they were lifted in a landmark international deal over its nuclear programme. The new measures took effect as the three European partners to the deal - the UK, France and Germany - activated the so-called snapback mechanism, accusing Iran of continued nuclear escalation and lack of co-operation. Iran suspended inspections of its nuclear facilities - a legal obligation under the terms of the 2015 deal - after Israel and the US bombed several of its nuclear sites and military bases in June. \",\n",
        "    \"Trump suggests Starmer could use military to control UK borders. Donald Trump suggested Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer could use the military to stop illegal migration at a news conference marking the end of the US president's second state visit to the UK. Trump said he discussed migration issues with Sir Keir during a meeting at his country residence Chequers. The US president talked about his policies to secure borders in the US and said the UK faced a similar challenge with migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats.\",\n",
        "    \"Trump's 50% tariff on India kicks in as Modi urges self-reliance. Donald Trump's steep 50% tariffs on India have kicked in, weeks after the US president issued an executive order hitting the Asian country with an additional 25% penalty over its purchases of Russian oil and weapons. This makes India - one of the US's strongest partners in the Indo-Pacific - among the countries paying the highest tariffs in the world. This could deal a blow to exports and growth in the world's fifth largest economy, given that the US was, until recently, India's largest trading partner.\"\n",

US President Donald Trump's abrupt decision to hike H-1B visa fees to $100,000 has prompted policymakers in Delhi to woo skilled Indians back home. A bureaucrat, who works closely with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, recently said that the government was actively encouraging overseas Indians to return and contribute to nation-building. Yet, another member of the PM's economic advisory council told a media conclave that H-1B visas have always served the interests of the host nation, and so the hike in fee boded well for India's ability to attract global talent. The crux of these arguments is that the time is ripe for India to engineer a reverse brain drain and lure some of the world's most talented professionals in technology, medicine and other innovative industries, who'd left the country in the past 30 years, back to the homeland.\n",

        "Третья молвила сестрица, — Я б для батюшки-царя Родила богатыря». Только вымолвить успела, Дверь тихонько заскрыпела, И в светлицу входит царь, Стороны той государь. Во всё время разговора Он стоял позадь забора; Речь последней по всему Полюбилася ему. «Здравствуй, красная девица, —\n",
        "Говорит он, — будь царица И роди богатыря Мне к исходу сентября. Вы ж, голубушки-сестрицы, Выбирайтесь из светлицы, Поезжайте вслед за мной, Вслед за мной и за сестрой: Будь одна из вас ткачиха, А другая повариха». В сени вышел царь-отец. Все пустились во дворец.\n",
        "Царь недолго собирался: В тот же вечер обвенчался. Царь Салтан за пир честной Сел с царицей молодой; А потом честные гости На кровать слоновой кости Положили молодых И оставили одних. В кухне злится повариха, Плачет у станка ткачиха, И завидуют оне Государевой жене. А царица молодая,\n",

Между тем, как он далёко Бьется долго и жестоко, Наступает срок родин; Сына бог им дал в аршин, И царица над ребенком Как орлица над орленком;\n",
        "Шлет с письмом она гонца, Чтоб обрадовать отца. А ткачиха с поварихой, С сватьей бабой Бабарихой, Извести ее хотят, Перенять гонца велят; Сами шлют гонца другого Вот с чем от слова до слова: «Родила царица в ночь Не то сына, не то дочь; Не мышонка, не лягушку, А неведому зверюшку». Как услышал царь-отец,\n",
        "Что донес ему гонец, В гневе начал он чудесить И гонца хотел повесить; Но, смягчившись на сей раз, Дал гонцу такой приказ: «Ждать царева возвращенья Для законного решенья». Едет с грамотой гонец, И приехал наконец. А ткачиха с поварихой, С сватьей бабой Бабарихой, Обобрать его велят; Допьяна гонца поят\n",
        "И в суму его пустую Суют грамоту другую — И привез гонец хмельной В тот же день приказ такой: «Царь велит своим боярам, Времени не тратя даром, И царицу и приплод Тайно бросить в бездну вод». Делать нечего: бояре, Потужив о государе И царице молодой, В спальню к ней пришли толпой. Объявили царску волю —\n",
