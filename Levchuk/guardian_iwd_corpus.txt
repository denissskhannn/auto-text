Celebrations and protests in the US and around the world mark International Women’s Day
Women took to the streets of cities across Europe, Africa and elsewhere to mark International Women’s Day with demands for ending inequality and gender-based violence.
On the Asian side of Turkey’s biggest city, Istanbul, a rally in Kadiköy saw members of dozens of women’s groups listen to speeches, dance and sing in the spring sunshine. The colorful protest was overseen by a large police presence, including officers in riot gear and a water cannon truck.
The government of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan declared 2025 the Year of the Family. Protesters pushed back against the idea of women’s role being confined to marriage and motherhood, carrying banners reading “Family will not bind us to life” and “We will not be sacrificed to the family”.
Critics have accused the government of overseeing restrictions on women’s rights and not doing enough to tackle violence against women.
The Turkish president in 2021 withdrew his country from a European treaty, dubbed the Istanbul Convention, that protects women from domestic violence. Turkey’s “We Will Stop Femicides” platform says 394 women were killed by men in 2024.
“There is bullying at work, pressure from husbands and fathers at home and pressure from patriarchal society. We demand that this pressure be reduced even further,” Yaz Gulgun, 52, said.
In many other European countries, women also protested against violence, for better access to gender-specific healthcare and for equal pay, among other issues.
In Poland , activists opened a center across from the parliament building in Warsaw where women can go to have abortions with pills, either alone or with other women.
Opening the center on International Women’s Day across from the legislature was a symbolic challenge to authorities in the traditionally Roman Catholic nation, which has one of Europe’s most restrictive abortion laws.
From Athens to Madrid, Paris, Munich, Zurich and Belgrade, and in many more cities across the European continent, women marched to demand an end to treatment as second-class citizens in society, politics, family and work.
In Madrid, protesters held up large hand-drawn pictures depicting Gisèle Pelicot, the woman who was drugged by her now ex-husband in France over the course of a decade so that she could be raped by dozens of men while unconscious. Pelicot has become a symbol for women all over Europe in the fight against sexual violence.
In the Nigerian capital of Lagos, thousands of women gathered at the Mobolaji Johnson stadium, dancing and signing and celebrating their womanhood. Many were dressed in purple, the traditional color of the women’s liberation movement.
In Russia , the women’s day celebrations had a more official tone, with honor guard soldiers presenting yellow tulips to girls and women during a celebration in St Petersburg.
In Berlin, the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, called for stronger efforts to achieve equality and warned against tendencies to roll back progress already made.
In the US, demonstrations popped up in cities including Washington DC, New York City and Los Angeles, with many protesters rallying against the Trump administration’s policies.
The marches, organized by the Women’s March feminist network, come seven weeks into Trump’s second term. Since returning to office, Trump has signed a string of executive actions that advocates say disproportionately affect women.
Some of these orders are geared toward cracking down on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in the federal government, signed just hours after his inauguration. The next day, Trump rescinded a decades-old executive order that had barred government contractors from discriminating based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin.
At least 300 protests were planned for Saturday across the country, according to the Women’s March website.
RefuseFascism.org, an organization in Oakland, California, working with Women’s March, invited members of its community to join the march on Saturday, outlining some of the actions they’re fighting against in a statement : “It is Trump blaming plane crashes on DEI. It is JD Vance denigrating women who don’t have children. And these towering misogynists have the audacity to claim their attacks on trans people are in the name of ‘protecting women’.”

‘Musk? He’s horrendous’: Martha Lane Fox on diversity, tech bros and International Women’s Day
A s Elon Musk grinned in the Oval Office, one of Britain’s most influential tech investors looked on in horror. “He is absolutely horrendous. I have said it multiple times: I think it is horrifying what is happening,” says Martha Lane Fox .
For the British peer and ex-Twitter board member, the sight of Musk holding forth from the bully pulpit of Donald Trump’s White House shows the Silicon Valley dream has gone sour.
“The richest man in the world, who can stand there alongside the president, and kind of carte blanche make jokes about how he’s carving up people’s jobs in the government. Then he can be there with a chainsaw laughing on stage…
“It is really, really alarming, and I find it extremely unpleasant at a values-based level – but also, just how can we be watching this in plain sight? It makes me feel very anxious. I think it is gross.”
In an interview with the Observer to mark International Women’s Day, the president of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) warned the diversity pushback orchestrated by Trump and his tech bro acolytes will not only damage society, but also the economy at large.
Since his return to the White House, the US president has shut down all federal diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, while Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) is ripping up funding schemes.
Some of the world’s biggest companies are following suit. Amid a wider pushback against everything from environmental targets to sustainable development, among the most prominent taking part are US finance and tech companies, including Goldman Sachs, Accenture and Amazon, while UK businesses such as GSK have also fallen in line .
“He needs to be contained,” Lady Lane Fox says of Musk’s role in the rollback. “I find it extraordinary that the richest man in the world is trampling all over these things and that we still have kind of fanboying from the tech sector. It’s already been corrosive for society, and I would argue it is going to continue to be.”
For businesses, she says the bottom line is that companies that take diversity seriously appeal to the widest possible employee talent pool and are better placed to target a broad range of customers. This, she adds, is about profit as much as social justice. However, she has a broader concern about the future.
“The first thing, it’s financial. But the second thing, it’s about power and money – like everything, right?
“If you’re looking at a sector like the digital sector, where there’s the growth in jobs, growth in opportunity – it is the growth sector in the economy. Yet you are not including a whole bunch of people in that. Then you are going to be creating inequality. Full stop. So it’s financial and it’s a question of social justice.”
Given the close ties between Britain and the US, there is a view that where corporate America treads, the UK naturally follows. But there are signs that some UK businesses – and even the British operations of some US companies – are prepared to stand apart.
The accountancy firm Deloitte instructed staff working on contracts for the US government to remove pronouns from their emails , while also announcing the end of its DEI programme. But its UK boss told staff its British operations remained “committed to [its] diversity goals”.
“It feels as though global companies rooted in the US are making a politically motivated slight shift in emphasis and tilt, through to rowing back everything. And it does feel a bit more tempered here,” says Lane Fox.
UK businesses have an opportunity to do something different, she says, which could bring financial benefits. “I think we’ll build more robust companies, attract talent and have a much better shot at building the most resilient companies of the future.”
For almost three decades, Lane Fox has built a career – and multimillion-pound fortune – in tech. She made her first big money floating Lastminute.com , the online travel site co-founded alongside fellow Oxford graduate Brent Hoberman in 1998.
She joined the board of Twitter – now X – in 2016, landing herself a huge payday in Musk’s $44bn hostile takeover in 2022, before he dissolved the board and appointed himself the sole director.
Seeing Musk in the Oval Office, parading his son X on his shoulders , made her question the gender divide. “Can you imagine if that was a woman? Can you imagine what that would look like? I mean, I just think the whole thing is really gross.”
But while railing against Musk in a personal capacity, the BCC president does not suggest this approach is for everyone. “It is really tricky to navigate. You have a responsibility to your customers and your employees that might be different to our personal view sometimes.”
Government regulation to enshrine diversity targets is also a bad idea, she says, preferring instead that companies report their progress. “Keeping it in the light, keeping up the reporting, is important – keeping up good investors, looking at the right metrics and investing in the right companies all helps.”
However, not enough progress is being made. Analysis this week showed that worsening unemployment and workforce participation for women has pushed the UK behind Canada to its lowest global ranking for workplace equality among large economies in a decade.
The gender pay gap has been declining slowly over time, but average pay is still 7% less for women than for men. It is a challenge Lane Fox is all too aware of. “Look at the data and it is really freaking depressing – and it is not moving,” she says.
“What worries me is that it’s far too easy to find numbers that I thought we were moving on from.
“In this week of International Women’s Day, we see representation at the executive level has gone back. I see progress on boards is still good at the FTSE 100 level, but bad at FTSE 250 and 350 level.
“I know there will be people in the sector thinking: ‘Oh, here she goes again.’ That’s true of many women [that people think that]. But it is so important to keep making these arguments.”

Lauren Price beats Natasha Jonas in women’s welterweight unification bout – as it happened
Here’s how the fighters measure up ahead of tonight’s main event. Both Jonas and Price came in safely under the welterweight division limit of 147lb at yesterday’s weigh-in. Jonas comes in with advantages of three inches in reach and two and a half inches in height, which could allow her to control the distance with her jab and prevent her opponent from getting inside. But Price is a decade younger, which could translate to an edge in speed, reflexes and endurance over the course of 10 rounds. Notably, both Jonas and Price are southpaws, which could create an interesting tactical battle with unusual angles.
That’s all for tonight. Thanks as always for following along with us and be sure to check out Donald McRae’s complete ringside report here .
“She was just too fast,” Jonas tells Sky Sports interviewer Andy Scott. “She just beat me to the punch every time. And I was trying to work out a way to get around and get shots off. I was trying to land one big shot instead of putting the combinations together.”
An emotional Jonas then breaks off her assessment to deliver a message to her family and supporters: “Can I just say to all my family and friends that traveled all the way from Liverpool – my daughter is here in the crowd – I apologize for the performance. And I still hope I made you proud. Thank you for spending your money and coming out here, all the fans, to make this a great occasion for female boxing.”
Jonas then continues to look back on the fight, saying: “I just just didn’t work my way around the quick shots. She does pack a little bit of power, to be fair to her as well, which I didn’t expect. I think I was landing, but it was only landing single hard shots, and it’s just not enough when you’re against a great operator like Lauren.”
Then comes the most difficult question of all. Jonas, 40, is asked what the future holds and whether that’s the last time we’ll see her in a professional ring.
“I think emotions are running high right now,” she says. “And [trainer Joe Gallagher] has been asking me to retire for a very long time. And I actually enjoy sitting next to you Andy, and [Sky Sports commentators] Anna [Smith] and Johnny [Nelson] and commentating on everyone else’s performances, so maybe we will have that afterwards. For right now, I’m going to go home and spend some time with my daughter.”
“Stepping up here tonight, what a venue, made history,” Price says. “But I’ve got to say a massive thank you to Tasha. We need perfect dance partners. [It was] a complete honor to share the ring with her. I respect her from what she done, not just for women’s boxing, but boxing. True legend. And it’s been an honor to share it with her.”
She adds: “Thank you to all my supporters who came out tonight. It’s been amazing. Not just my Welsh fans, but the British fans, everyone. If it wasn’t for you, we wouldn’t have our big nights to shine, so thank you very much.”
Asked to break down what turned out to be a one-sided affair, Price gives her assessment.
“I knew obviously Tash, she’d be quick to start off,” she says. “It was all about using my angles, using my speed, using my jab, using my feints. And I thought my right hook worked pretty well tonight. And like always, using my feet. They helped me in the amateurs, that’s what won me the Olympic gold medal and it’s going to get me to the top in the pros.”
The conversation turns to what’s next. The answer should come as no surprise. Price now holds three of the four major world title belts at 147lb. The WBO belt is held by the American Mikaela Mayer, who is due to fight Sandy Ryan on 29 March in Las Vegas in a rematch of their heated September bout at Madison Square Garden.
Price says that she “100%” wants to take on the winner of that fight, which represents an opportunity to unify all four titles and become the undisputed champion at welterweight.
“I honestly believe I can become undisputed,” Price says. “I want to go on. I want to create a lasting legacy. I want to follow in the footsteps of Katie Taylor. It started with [beating Jessica] McCaskill and now Jonas. So the winner of Mayer and Sandy I’d like next.”
Lauren Price has added Jonas’ WBC and IBF welterweight titles to her WBA strap to become a unified champion at 147lb. The scores were as wide as expected: 98-93, 100-90 and 98-92. (The Guardian had it 100-90.)
Round 10
Jonas knows she needs a knockout to win and she comes out swinging for the 10th and final round, loading up on her shots in the opening 20 seconds. But Price evades the haymakers and calmly peppers away with counters. What poise and composure! Thirty seconds to go and Price punishes her opponent with a violent right hook. Jonas lands a very hard left hand in the final 10 seconds ... her best shot of the night! But it’s far too little, far too late. There’s the bell and it’s a masterclass from Lauren Price, who once the official scores are tallied and announced will surely become a unified welterweight champion.
Guardian’s unofficial score: Jonas 9-10 Price (Jonas 90-100 Price)
Round 9
Jonas takes a tumble to the canvas early in the round but the referee correctly rules it a slip. Price looks fresh as a daisy, picking up right where she left off in the eighth. Jonas wears a look of discouragement, out of ideas as Price continues to bounce punches off her head behind her blurring hand speed. Another round for Price. Two more minutes.
Guardian’s unofficial score: Jonas 9-10 Price (Jonas 81-90 Price)
Round 8
Jonas is trying to pursue Price around the ring but the legs aren’t there and her punches lack snap. Price countering with perfection, and boxing beautifully and beating Jonas to the punch at every exchanges. A different class.
Guardian’s unofficial score: Jonas 9-10 Price (Jonas 72-80 Price)
Round 7
Jonas getting countered to death and Price countinues to outthrow and outland her foe. Another clear Price round. The only remaining drama is whether she can close the show with a knockout. She very well might at the present clip.
Guardian’s unofficial score: Jonas 9-10 Price (Jonas 63-70 Price)
Round 6
Another straightforward round, but Price’s shots are landing flusher now and with a more ominous sense of menace. Jonas eats a left-right combination directly to her nose. Price continues picking apart her opponent from mid-range. This is not a competitive fight. Jonas looking every bit her 40 years while Price operating at peak levels.
Guardian’s unofficial score: Jonas 9-10 Price (Jonas 54-60 Price)
Round 5
More of the same from Price, who is the busier, slicker and more effective fighter. Jonas looks out of her depth, unable to pull the trigger. Price using her excellent footwork to create different lines of attack, further complicating matters for the Liverpudlian. A total shutout bordering on a mismatch as we enter the second half of the scheduled 10 rounds.
Guardian’s unofficial score: Jonas 9-10 Price (Jonas 45-50 Price)
Round 4
More good work from Price, who’s really found a groove. The constant in-and-out movement is creating scoring opportunities and making Jonas look flat-footed. The round ends with a two-way exchange on the inside, but not enough to erase another Price round. Four rounds and eight minutes down and Jonas really hasn’t done much. Speed kills.
Guardian’s unofficial score: Jonas 9-10 Price (Jonas 36-40 Price)
Round 3
Price’s deft hand and foot speed is not allowing Jonas to press her physical advantages. She lands a left hand on the inside before darting out of harm’s way. Price continues to dispense eye-catching flurries of punches. Another right from Price, who is throwing and landing more. Blistering speed. Jonas complains to referee Marcus McDonnell that she was hit on the back of the head but the third man doesn’t react. Another solid round for Price.
Guardian’s unofficial score: Jonas 9-10 Price (Jonas 27-30 Price)
Round 2
Price aggressive from the bell, darting forward again and throwing punches. Jonas calm in retreat, taking measure of her foe. Price the busier fighter in these opening stages. Price lands a right hook upstairs as they meet on the inside. Price catches Jonas with another right hook on the fourth punch of a combo that sends Jonas reeling backwards, but it looks like she lost her balance more than she was hurt. Another round for Price, easier to score than the first.
Guardian’s unofficial score: Jonas 9-10 Price (Jonas 18-20 Price)
Round 1
There’s the bell! The fighters meet in the center of the ring. Jonas opens with a jab to the midsection as Price circles backward into the right, away from her opponent’s lead hand. Price bursts into the pocket and throws a flurry of punches but Jonas eludes them all while moving in reverse. Price lands a right hand through Jonas’s guard. A feeling-out round for both with neither landing anything of great significance, but Price did just enough to take it.
Guardian’s unofficial score: Jonas 9-10 Price (Jonas 9-10 Price)
Here we go. The final instructions have been given by the referee, the seconds are out and we’ll pick it up with round-by-round coverage from here!
It’s time for the main event. The lights have gone down and the ring announcer has taken his position and summoned each fighter. First it’s Lauren Price, the WBA’s welterweight champion. She emerges to a recording of the old Welsh standard Yma o Hyd performed by Corau Meibion and Dafydd Iwan wearing an all black robe with black sequined trim.
Now it’s Jonas, the WBC and IBF champion of the 147lb division, whose entrance is preceded by the poet and spoken word artist Sophia Thakur . Shortly after the Liverpudlian enters the hall to hearty roars wearing a Union Jack-inspired robe with gold trim. She pauses on the platform near the tunnel before Beyoncé’s Run the World (Girls) pipes in from the speakers, the cue for her final approach to the squared circle. Not much longer now.

Here’s how the fighters measure up ahead of tonight’s main event. Both Jonas and Price came in safely under the welterweight division limit of 147lb at yesterday’s weigh-in. Jonas comes in with advantages of three inches in reach and two and a half inches in height, which could allow her to control the distance with her jab and prevent her opponent from getting inside. But Price is a decade younger, which could translate to an edge in speed, reflexes and endurance over the course of 10 rounds. Notably, both Jonas and Price are southpaws, which could create an interesting tactical battle with unusual angles.
“It was very rough and tough,” Caroline Dubois says to the in-ring interviewer. “And watching her fights previously with the team, that’s what she did. She just charges in, head down and swing for the rooftops, and she did exactly what I expected.”
Dubois is then asked about her decision to stand and trade with her opponent during the final two rounds rather than play it safe with a lead on the scorecards. Did she give someone a chance that didn’t really have a chance in the fight?
“Maybe,” she says. “But I feel like I need to learn how to fight on the inside. It’s one thing doing it in sparring and stuff, but it’s another thing doing in the ring where, you know, like the crowd, the lights, all you guys, the judges, it’s important to master that there as well. And I tried to do it. I don’t know if I was successful, but I tried.”
The interview then swings to Dubois’ trainer Shane McGuigan, who gives his assessment.
“I thought she was brilliantly for eight rounds,” McGuigan says. “The last couple of rounds, she got dragged in and also lost her face a little bit, but Caroline hasn’t been feeling the best. There’s no excuses. But she hasn’t been feeling the best. She was fighting a bit of a virus for last 10 days. But this is the most amazing experience for her. She was she wanted to be involved in it, and she kept saying, ‘I’m fine. I’m fine.’ But maybe in those last four minutes, they were telling.”
Caroline Dubois has retained her WBC lightweight title by a hard-fought majority decision over Bo Mi Re Shin. After running out to a wide lead on the scorecards, the London southpaw was wobbled by a concussive right hand in the ninth round then pushed to the limit in a grueling 10th. But she made it to the final bell before the ringside judges made it official by scores of 95-95, 98-93 and 98-92.
Caroline Dubois has made her way to the ring for tonight’s chief support bout. Our ringside correspondent checks in:
The extremely shallow pool of premium talent in women’s boxing is hard to ignore but such nights can only help attract prospective new fighters. As the Albert Hall fills to around 80% of its capacity it feels important to remember that women’s boxing was still banned in Britain in 1998 .
I also think British boxing has a clear future star. Caroline Dubois is the most gifted young female fighter in this country and the atmosphere is really starting to build as she prepares to showcase her vast potential against Bo Mi Re Shen, the supposedly tough and resilient South Korean.
One boxer that we regrettably won’t be seeing tonight is Olympic bronze medalist Cindy Ngamba. The 26-year-old from Bolton, whose extraordinary backstory came into a global spotlight last summer, was due to make her professional debut against Kirstie Bavington tonight only for her promoter to announced her withdrawal due to a medical issue.
“Cindy Ngamba will not be making her professional debut on Friday night after a pre-fight medical examination revealed an issue requiring further investigation,” Boxxer said in a statement Thursday. “The health and safety of fighters remains the highest priority, and Cindy will undergo further tests in the coming days.”
At the Paris Games, Ngamba became the first athlete competing as a refugee to earn a medal when she took bronze in the middleweight category.
“I am very disappointed that I will not be able to make my professional debut on Friday as I had worked very hard to be in great shape and was really looking forward to the occasion and boxing at the Royal Albert Hall,” Ngamba said in a statement posted on her social media channels.
On Instagram, Ngamba added her thanks to “all of the people that that have helped and supported me in preparing for this fight”.
Ngamba, who cannot return to her home country of Cameroon because she is gay, has lived in Britain for the past 15 years. She spoke at length to Donald McRae for an interview that ran earlier this week.
Karriss Artingstall has just won a 10-round decision over Raven Chapman to claim the British featherweight title. The Tokyo Olympic bronze medalist from Macclesfield scored a second-round knockdown with a left hand before strolling to a unanimous verdict by scores of 97-92, 98-91 and 96-93.
“I’m just proud of myself for getting back in the ring, if I’m honest,” Artingstall says. “Last year it was an odd one, like I just mentally wasn’t there within myself when I was in the ring. So I’m just mega-proud of myself for even getting in the fight, never mind beating a top-class operator like Raven, getting about along the way and doing my first 10-rounder. So there’s things to work on, of course, but I’m just mega-proud of myself for getting the win and being back in ring.”
Asked who she wants to fight next, Artingstall wastes no time: “I’d love to go back and speak to my team and see what they think next. But I believe [IBF featherweight champion] Nina Meinke’s got a world title. I believe if I can get that off her, then I think it makes for a perfect fight against me and Sky Nicolson.”
Conveniently enough Nicolson, who holds the IBF title at 126lb, is at ringside at the moment doing commentary for Sky Sports.
“I’d love to get that fight at the end of the year, 100%,” adds Artingstall, whose Tokyo bronze came directly at Nicolson’s expense in the quarter-finals. “I think if I get a world title of Nina Meinke, why shouldn’t that happen? I think the fans would love to see give her a chance at getting a revenge from the Olympics. We look forward to it.”
Next up: Caroline Dubois will defend her WBC lightweight title against South Korea’s Bo Mi Re Shin in the co-feature bout. That’s the final action before Jonas and Price make their entrances.
Tonight marks the first night of boxing in four years at the Royal Albert Hall and only the fifth since 1999. But BoxRec’s exhaustive annals show the 154-year-old concert hall on the northern edge of South Kensington has a surprisingly rich fistic history, with at least 470 cards staged here down the years going back to 1918 – exactly one month after the end of the first world war.
Speaking of the great man , McRae wrote a piece for Sunday’s Observer on his latest book, The Last Bell: Life, Death and Boxing , out next week and published by Simon and Schuster.
When I was a boy, living in South Africa, I fell for Muhammad Ali. As graceful as he was provocative, Ali amazed me with his uncanny ability, despite apartheid, to entrance black and white South Africans. He made us laugh and dazzled us with his outrageous skill and courage. I have followed boxing ever since, often obsessively, for more than 50 years.
In 1996, after I spent five years tracking Mike Tyson, James Toney, Roy Jones Jr, Chris Eubank Sr and Naseem Hamed, my book Dark Trade allowed me to become a full-time writer. I owe this gift to boxing but our relationship is not easy. Boxing is as crooked and destructive as it is magnificent and transformative.
I have given so much of my life to thinking and writing about giants of the ring, and thousands of lesser fighters who are often as interesting. But even zealots grow weary. For a while my family and work, as well as books, movies and Arsenal, filled my head as much as boxing. There was fleeting freedom from the ring.
Then, in September 2018, my sister, Heather, died shockingly soon after my mother had been diagnosed with terminal cancer. My father would endure the same diagnosis less than a year later. I lost all three of them – and then my mother-in-law died on the first anniversary of my mother’s death.
I have spent the past six years working on my fifth and probably final book about boxing. More than just a prop amid the grief, I wanted to remember how boxing made me feel so alive. It has always been a bleak and dirty business but, at its best, boxing is like nothing else. It can be as beautiful as it is brutal, as glorious as it is painful.

Our man at ringside tonight is the inestimable Donald McRae , who’s just checked in with a dispatch from inside the room:
It’s good to be at the Royal Albert Hall on a very different, and significant, night for women’s boxing in the UK. This is a really beautiful venue for boxing – as intimate as it is grand – and it’s currently about two-thirds full. And it’s striking that the crowd features almost as many women as men shouting out their support for the undercard boxers. Some dubious and great fighters have boxed here – including Primo ‘the Ambling Alp’ Carnera, Reggie and Ronnie Kray, Henry Cooper, Muhammad Ali, Frank Bruno, Nigel Benn, Lennox Lewis, Naseem Hamed and Marco Antonio Barrera. It’s great to feel the history – and to look ahead, hopefully, to some decent fights and a really intriguing headline bout between Jonas and Price.
Jasmina Zapotoczna has just won a 10-round split decision over Britain’s Chloe Watson. Two of the ringside judges handed down identical cards of 96-95 in favor of the Poland-born, Yorkshire-based flyweight, overruling a 97-93 score for the Merseysider. Zapotoczna is now the European champion at the 112lb division.
Two more preliminary bouts to go before the main event.
Welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of a groundbreaking night of boxing at London’s historic Royal Albert Hall. For the first time, an all-women’s card takes center stage at this storied venue, headlined by a high-stakes welterweight title unification clash between Natasha Jonas and Lauren Price.
Tonight’s main event represents a compelling clash of styles and generations. Jonas (16-2-1, 9 KO), the 40-year-old Merseysider who holds the WBC and IBF titles at welterweight, has defied the odds in the later stages of her career, moving up in weight to claim world titles before dropping back down to 147lb in pursuit of undisputed glory. A crisp counterpuncher with knockout power, Jonas’ experience on the biggest stages could be the deciding factor tonight. But will it be enough to overcome the speed, youth and technical brilliance of her undefeated foe?
Lauren Price (8-0, 2 KO) was one of the faces of British boxing even before seeing off Chicago investment banker Jessica McCaskill last year to win the WBA’s version of the welterweight crown. A Tokyo Olympic gold medalist with a deep amateur pedigree, the 30-year-old Welsh southpaw has made a flying start as a professional, relying on her exceptional speed, ring IQ and fluid movement to overwhelm opponents. Despite her relative inexperience in the paying ranks, Price is a fighter on the fast track and determined to make a statement by dethroning a legend.
Beyond the belts, tonight marks another milestone for women’s boxing. The Royal Albert Hall, steeped in sporting and cultural history, plays host to a night dedicated entirely to female fighters – something unthinkable just a decade ago . With the sport’s rapid growth and an increasing appetite for top-tier women’s bouts, this event is both a celebration and a showcase of the elite talent driving the revolution on the eve of International Women’s Day .
And it’s not just Jonas and Price in the spotlight. In the co-feature bout, rising star Caroline Dubois defends her WBC lightweight title, further adding to the significance of the occasion.
The main event ringwalks are expected around 10pm local. Stay with us for round-by-round updates, analysis and reaction.
Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here’s a look at tonight’s headliners in action at the media workouts earlier this week.
The Guardian will have round-by-round updates, analysis and instant reaction in this space.
In the UK, Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Action will broadcast the card. Subscribers can use the Sky Go app on compatible devices. The main event ringwalks are expected around 10pm GMT.
In the US, the card will be carried on TrillerTV+. The main event ringwalks are expected around 5pm ET.

Writers’ work built on women’s labour
Setting aside the grandiose claim that JRR Tolkien was “one of the most influential literary figures of all time” ( ‘Reduced to nonsense’: JRR Tolkien’s irritation with typist revealed in archive, 6 March ), the focus on his derision of his typist serves yet again to conceal the uncounted hours and years of women’s labour that has gone into male authors’ work, as typists, indexers, decipherers of meaning and supporters of ego, without which their work wouldn’t have seen the light of day. I daresay this worker was thinking “Not another elf!” as she put her unacknowledged effort into enhancing Tolkien’s reputation. Karen Adler Nottingham

Australian women are doing 50% more housework than men. It’s creating ‘volcanic levels of resentment’
This International Women’s Day, Meg’s* life will feel no less chaotic than it does on any other day.
Like her husband, the 43-year-old from Sydney works five days a week – but she also has a second job, freelancing in the evenings. They have three young children, a mortgage and no family in Australia.
“I’m always whizzing around cleaning like a mad Tasmanian devil,” the creative director says. “As soon as you walk through the door, you see a thousand things that need to be done.
“Last night, my husband asked me if he had any clean boxer shorts – and the sad thing is, I’m the only one who knows the answer.”

She is not alone. The latest Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (Hilda) survey shows that in 2022, men spent an average of 12.8 hours a week on housework – exactly the same amount as they did 20 years earlier – while women do 50% more (an average of 18.4 hours).
In heterosexual couples with children under 15, men did one-third less housework, along with about half the childcare of their female partners. And, while women were spending less time on housework than they were in 2002, they were doing more hours of paid work and more unpaid care work.
All up, women had nearly two fewer hours a week for themselves than men – and they’re not OK with it.
Dr Inga Lass, the report’s co-author and senior research fellow at the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, found that women found the division of unpaid labour was unfair and were less satisfied with their share than men.
“I’ve got so used to doing housework on top of everything else that I’m just a well-oiled machine – that every now and then erupts into volcanic levels of resentment,” Meg says. “And then I get up and do it all over again.”
“This is not a surprise to me,” political economist Prof Elizabeth Hill says of the Hilda findings. She emphasises that, even when a woman was employed and her male partner was not, she still did most of the unpaid care.
Her own research with the University of Sydney reflects the very same finding: it is women’s lives that have bent to the modern demands of earning, procreating and housekeeping – not men’s.
“I don’t think there are many households where the parents are feeling that it’s particularly sustainable at this point in time,” says Georgie Dent, head of advocacy group The Parenthood.
There is another way of looking at the data however, says Peter Siminski of the University of Technology Sydney. We’re doing less housework overall (thanks to technology and outsourcing) and the figures reflect a positive – if slow – narrowing of gender gaps around housework.
Yet Siminski’s own research, again, mirrors Hilda: how much we can earn does not impact how work is divided at home.
Gender norms do, Lass suggests.
“I think it starts with how boys and girls are being raised, and what they’re being taught. There’s this hypothesis that women are often more judged if the house is a bit messy, while men are cut some slack.”
Even accounting for an increase in men’s housework because women have decreased theirs, “women end up doing more overall when you count together employment and housework and childcare.
“And this looks to me like women still feel compelled to get more done in the house,” she says.
As pervasive as our expectations – or those of our partners – is the structure of our labour markets, care systems, schools, workplace practices and policy settings, which, Hill says, presume that women are more interested in, and capable of, care and domestic labour than men.
(Stay-at-home dads – of which there were 80,000 in 2018, according to the Australian Institute of Family Studies – are welcome and important changes at the margins, but make little impact on the overall numbers, she says.)
Australia and New Zealand is the third highest region for unpaid domestic work done by women, according to UN data from 2023.
Only in central and southern Asia, northern Africa and western Asia did women do more unpaid care and domestic work.
A 2024 report by the Australian Institute of Family Studies’ Dr Jenny Baxter showed that in 78% of couple families in Australia, the mental load was always or usually carried by the mother. Hill’s research found that the burden of care responsibilities fundamentally shaped women’s daily lives and capacity to work.
Some were resentful, others were resigned – most were exhausted.
The upshot is that both men and women miss out. There are known to be significant benefits for men who are involved in family care in terms of their health and wellbeing, says Hill.
But when they do try to mix work and care, research shows they can face an economic penalty and discrimination in training and promotion opportunities.
“We talk about the motherhood penalty – there seems to be the emergence of a kind of a parenthood penalty, and we need to push back against that really strongly,” she says. “It’s kind of unsurprising given that’s been women’s experience for decades.”
For Meg, there’s a sense of never getting ahead, even with more childcare. Lass suggests this is because of increasing expectations around raising children and their exposure to extracurricular activities.
We have more efficiency-boosting technology, but our smartphones blur the lines between work and family time while turbocharging stress and pressure, says Dent. In 2002, housework was not interrupted by the patter of school WhatsApp updates.
“It’s triage, making a mental hierarchy of everything,” Meg says of her constant domestic juggling. “And don’t get me started on sports – you’ve got to sign them up, jigsaw them into the right classes, sort out their kit: that’s the mental-load shit.”
Meg says her transformation from being an equal partner in her relationship began when she gave birth for the first time. It’s an observation that is borne out, verbatim, in the Hilda data. Up until having a baby, women do roughly the same share of housework and paid work as their male partners, then roles dramatically diverge.
“Having babies just shifts the dynamic [within] couples so much. It puts women on this invisible back foot. You’re at home all the time and that becomes your realm, so you start doing all the domestic chores,” she says.
Get it right and get it right early, the data suggests. The birth of a first child is what sets a household’s patterns around care and housework. Hill says that in Nordic countries – where there is a significant investment in non-gendered parental leave – fathers who care for their infants continue to be involved closely in the care of their children in the subsequent years.
Dent says Australia has not reached the tipping point where extended paid parental leave meaningfully shifts how couples care for their children and run their households.
“In the countries where they have actually increased men’s participation in caregiving in a really meaningful sense, that has never happened by accident,” she says.
Alongside an acceleration in investment into paid parental leave and childcare systems, Australia needs more good flexible work – jobs that involve training and career opportunities.
“We’re heading in the right direction, but we need to go much faster, and we need to include all aspects of society,” says Hill.
Also, she says, “frankly, men need to step up”.
That’s true to Meg’s experience.
“I’m my own worst enemy because I don’t delegate –” Meg stops herself mid-sentence. “Or, is that just another thing I’m taking responsibility for?”

One in eight women killed by men are over 70, report reveals
One in eight women killed by men in the last 15 years were aged over 70, figures show, with a specialist charity reporting a growing number of older victims of domestic abuse seeking help.
A landmark report , released ahead of International Women’s Day by the Femicide Census, delves into the deaths of 2000 women killed by men. It shows that 262 women over the age of 70 have been killed since 2009.
Among them were Margaret Biddolph, 78, and Anne Leyland, 88, who were killed by debt-ridden taxi driver Andrew Flood in Southport in 2012. In 2018 Craig Keogh, 26, raped and murdered a 72-year-old before burgling her home.
They also include older women who were also subjected to extreme sexual violence. In 2024 the Guardian’s Killed Women Count campaign reported on every woman allegedly killed by a man.
Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reveal that 375,000 people aged over 60 in England and Wales reported domestic abuse between April 2022 to March 2023. But a lack of media focus and specialist services meant the abuse of older women was often hidden and unexplored, said Karen Ingala Smith, co-founder of the Femicide Census.
“The deaths of older women don’t get enough attention,” she said. “I think that the vulnerability of older women, either living on their own or in care homes, isn’t properly recognised.”
Research by Prof Hannah Bows at Durham University showed that between 2010 and 2015, one in four domestic homicides involved a victim over the age of 60, with women more likely to be victims and men perpetrators. “This is particularly significant when you consider that people aged 60+ accounted for around 18% of our population at the time, but made up 25% of all domestic homicides,” she said. “So the idea that older people are less at risk of being murdered isn’t borne out by the data.”
According to Age UK, nearly two-thirds (63%) of adult family homicide victims are aged 55 and over, with older people as likely to be subjected to abuse from an adult child or grandchild as they are from an intimate partner. “It is both shocking and tragic,” said Caroline Abrahams, the charity’s director. “Older people are often overlooked in domestic abuse policies and services because their experiences don’t always match stereotypical perceptions of domestic abuse.”
Veronica Gray, deputy CEO at Hourglass, a charity working to prevent abuse of older people in the UK, said call demand had increased by 50% over the past two years. “Whether that is due to increased awareness, or an increase in cases, it is probably impossible to tell,” she said. “But I think it’s likely that with an ageing population there is more widespread abuse.”
Older women may also be less likely to disclose abuse, whether by a partner, child or grandchild, said Prof Sarah Lonbay, an expert in domestic abuse of older people at the University of Sunderland.
Her research with the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) revealed that the abuse of some older victims had started when it was still considered a “family matter”. She said: “When they become older they may be less likely to contact services or disclose their experiences because they feel like they might not be believed, might be dismissed, or they might feel that actually they’re taking services away from younger women who need it more.”
Femicide Census’ report also showed that older women are more likely to be killed during a burglary than younger women, with 67% of women killed in the context of a burglary over the age of 60. These women were likely to be linked to “vulnerability that comes with their age: they are more likely to live alone and to be physically less strong,” according to the report.
Yet how women were killed during burglaries suggests that their deaths were not unintentional and were strongly linked to misogyny, said the report. In the killings of women over 60 by a stranger during a robbery, nearly half involved overkill, the use of excessive, gratuitous violence beyond that necessary to cause the victim’s death. At least four of the killings included sexual violence.
“We have to ask why we see the use of sexual and sustained violence against elderly women who are unknown to the much younger men who kill them,” said Ingala Smith. “The misogynistic intent in these killings is clear.”

‘Poor taste’: Brisbane school holds nappy-changing activity to mark International Women’s Day
A Brisbane school has been criticised for acting “in poor taste” after posting images of a nappy-changing activity held on International Women’s Day on Facebook.
Stretton State College posted the photo of students with nappies and dolls among images of different events held to celebrate the day. They included selling cookies and a photo station with a border featuring the slogan “inspire inclusion”.
A spokesperson for Queensland’s Department of Education said the nappy-changing activity was organised by a group of students to celebrate International Women’s Day, with the oversight of staff and the endorsement of the student council.
“Today we celebrated International Women’s Day and took time to celebrate and bring awareness to the need for a world that is free of bias, stereotypes and discrimination. A world that celebrates achievements, diversity and inclusivity across the globe. #inspireinclusion ,” a post accompanying the Facebook photos read.

Students also raised money for body image and eating disorder charity the Butterfly Foundation.
Kara Williams, whose two daughters attend the school, said the activity was “in poor taste” and didn’t reflect the message of inclusion and empowerment that the day was meant to express.
“One daughter said ‘it’s a bit weird’ [after the event],” she said.
“And the younger daughter went ‘What? What’s the point of that?’
“I’m sure that just from the sort of shock and disbelief, I think they probably agreed with me and thought it was not appropriate.”
Williams, who said she wasn’t made aware of the idea in advance, expressed hope that the school has a nappy-changing station if they hold a celebration of International Men’s Day on 19 November.
“I’m a registered midwife. So I run antenatal classes with parents, I support same-sex relationships. A lot of my job is around education. And, yes, nappy changing is a practical skill that would be helpful. If an impending parent was to learn that’s fine. Definitely not a high school student.
“Like why can’t we have guest speakers or activities focused on bigger issues rather than can you change a nappy?”
A student from the state school complained that male students had taken the display as an excuse for sexist behaviour.
“It’s just so dumb and a bit kind of hurtful,” they said.
“Just makes me so mad that people connect women to nappy changing.”
Stretton parent Andrea Wildin said she planned to raise the activity with the school parents and citizens association at their next meeting.
“It is definitely one of the things you want your daughter to aspire to is being a good mother. But you also want therm to aspire to being in a trade, and to being in Stem. So perhaps nappy changing could have been combined with robotics,” she said.
The school also held a number of other events for International Women’s Day including a school assembly, student and staff rock band performances, student games and activities, and a senior girls charity lunch.
A spokesperson for the department said the assembly focused on topics “such as closing the gender pay gap, challenging gender stereotypes and the path to achieving gender equality”.
“The activity in question was designed by the year 9 student cohort and welcomed all students to participate and challenge gender stereotypes,” they said
“The school has not received any complaints regarding the event and the response in the community has been extremely positive.
“No further details can be provided due to student and staff privacy issues.”
Stretton State College is one of Australia’s largest schools, with 3,450 students from prep to year 12, in the fast-growing outer suburbs of Brisbane.

How did I mark Mother’s Day? With a dream about putting mine in a home
T here is usually a bit of space between International Women’s Day and Mother’s Day, which means we don’t have to run straight from the swill of empowerment platitudes into the tooth-aching blancmange of filial adoration. I try to avoid the first and keep the second as an opportunity to guilt-trip my children and eat cheese with my mother, defiantly asking no questions at any point in March about the female or maternal condition.
This year IWD and Mother’s Day abutted each other in the same week. While I laboured in my waking hours to ignore them and concentrate on guilt and cheese, my subconscious didn’t get off so lightly.
I had a dream on the eve of Mother’s Day. I was at a big table with a frilly, white cloth. Sundry family elders were there, but also Polly Toynbee . They were all telling me and my sister not to put our mum in a home, while we went: “Relax! She’ll be fine – she likes care homes.”
Surfacing to consciousness, I managed to wake myself up properly with laughter. How basic can you get? It’s like having a dream on Christmas Eve in which Father Christmas tells you not to eat too much, and you say: “Don’t sweat it, Santa. I’ll need something to soak up the too many drinks I’m scheduling.”
Four hours later, I was recounting all this to my mother and my sister at my mother’s table. There was no napery, nor aunts and uncles, but otherwise it was a close approximation of what had passed in the night. She said: “You actually did put me in a home. I wish I’d known Polly Toynbee could stop you – I’d have tweeted her.”
This much is true – a couple of months ago, we arranged a fortnight’s respite in a place that was much more like a landlocked cruise ship than a home. This distinction seemed important in the moment: “That wasn’t a home – it was more of a mini-break. Plus, my esteemed colleague couldn’t have stopped me: her function in the dream was more what the Jungians would call a golden shadow, the ideal person whom I wish I was more like.”
“Yeah, and she thinks you shouldn’t have put me in a home!”
“It was a mini-break!”

Alicia Keys criticised for Women’s Day event in ‘misogynist’ Saudi Arabia
Performer Alicia Keys projects a powerful position on women’s rights, hosting a regular Women to Women summit and posting inspirationally on Instagram on Friday for International Women’s Day . But the singer-songwriter’s message is undermined for some by the revelation that she is hosting the third edition of her summit this weekend in Saudi Arabia.
The American performer and her guests, including Pharrell Williams , best known for his worldwide hit Happy, are to discuss “how women are pushing the culture forward in Saudi Arabia and around the world”, she has announced, before the get-together in the coastal city of Jeddah.
“I am thrilled to be back on stage, this time in Jeddah, performing in a place I have never performed in before, and in a way I never have in this region,” Keys said. “I’m also so inspired to connect in a meaningful way with the amazing women there to discuss cultural, creative and boundary-pushing narratives we are collectively and individually leading. In light of International Women’s Day, it’s the perfect time to discuss important issues affecting us.”
In response, human rights activists, including Peter Tatchell , have called on the 43-year-old star to boycott Saudi Arabia, a country that restricts women’s activities and persecutes several minority groups . “No artists should be going to Saudi unless they speak out publicly to demand women’s freedom and an end to other human rights abuses in the country, including the freeing of all political prisoners,” said Tatchell.
He added: “Alicia Keys and Pharrell Williams should not be performing in Saudi Arabia. It’s a dictatorship that persecutes women, LGBTs and religious and ethnic minorities. Women are in jail because of the country’s sexist laws. The regime murdered and dismembered the journalist Jamal Khashoggi .”
The women’s event is staged in conjunction with the country’s Formula One grand prix and is backed by Keys’ husband, the rapper and record producer Swizz Beatz, and his Good Intentions creative agency, as well as the international music platform MDLBeast. Keys will also sing with Williams before the grand prix.
“It is total hypocrisy for Saudi Arabia to host Alicia Keys for an International Women’s Day event when the regime jails advocates for women’s equality, ” said Tatchell. “I’m shocked that she is colluding with this whitewashing of Saudi misogyny.”
The singer, whose childhood is the subject of the hit Broadway musical Hell’s Kitchen[https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/nov/19/hells-kitchen-alicia-keys-musical-review], is making her third visit to Saudi Arabia . Last year, she also held the Women to Women summit there in the city of AlUla.
Marking International Women’s Day on social media Keys said: “I want you to remove any ideas in your mind that you are not going to create the destiny that you believe in for yourself. I want you to remove that from your vocabulary, the word “not” or “can’t” or “won’t”, let’s get rid of that.”

It’s 10 years since Gamergate – the industry must now stand up to far-right trolls
T en years ago, a game developer’s aggrieved ex-boyfriend published a vindictive screed accusing her of trading sex for favourable reviews of her indie game. This was leapt upon by the least savoury corner of the 2014 internet, 4chan, and kicked off a harassment campaign that broadened to include all women working in video game development or the gaming press, as well as the industry’s LGBTQ+ community. Sensing blood in the water, “alt-right” agitators on YouTube and Steve Bannon’s Breitbart jumped on the bandwagon, and soon began to steer it – and Gamergate, as this manufactured outrage became known, mutated into one of the first fronts of the modern culture wars, driven by social media, misogyny and the weaponised disaffection of young men. Many of its tactics became part of the Trump election playbook .
This week, a 16-person narrative design studio has found itself at the centre of a conspiracy theory that holds it responsible for the insidious prevalence of “wokery” in modern video games. A group with more than 200,000 followers on PC games storefront Steam, as well as thousands in a Discord chat channel, believes that Sweet Baby Inc is secretly forcing game developers to change the bodies, ethnicities and sexualities of video game characters to conform to “woke” ideology. They think that Sweet Baby has written and controlled almost every popular video game of the past five years, shutting straight white men out. As Trump once again heads out on the campaign trail, this is part of a broader far right panic about diversity and inclusion that has already resulted in proposed regressive anti-women and anti-woke legislation in the US and elsewhere.
The agency in question has of course done nothing of the sort. It is simply a narrative development studio, the video game equivalent of script doctors, that works with game developers to ensure their plots make sense and their characters aren’t embarrassingly out of touch. The consultancy’s mission statement is to “make games more engaging, more fun, more meaningful and more inclusive”. It cannot dictate that developers feature, for example, black female leads in their games. It does not have the power to dictate anything. But its employees are nonetheless bearing the brunt of an online mob’s ire. They are being doxed, threatened and abused online.
Ten years ago, it was female games journalists and critics in the firing line. This time, it’s narrative designers. But the conspiracists’ message is the same: diversity has no place in games. If you are a woman, queer or a person of colour working in this industry, you should expect the worst.
Nathan Grayson of Aftermath and Alyssa Mercante of Kotaku have both investigated the origins and sprawling nature of the Sweet Baby conspiracy theory. Its proponents draw preposterous connections between the consultancy and BlackRock, and the funding crisis affecting the wider games industry. This is far from the first time since Gamergate that such harassment has spilled over: depressingly, coordinated abuse against game developers is now somewhat routine, especially if they do something so audacious as to include pride flags in Spider-Man’s Manhattan, or take their time implementing mod support for Baldur’s Gate 3. A full 91% of devs surveyed by the Game Developers Conference last year said that harassment from players was an issue, 42% calling it a “very serious” issue.
When Gamergate was going on, the silence from much of the video games industry was deafening. Instead of standing up for the people that were being targeted, almost everyone who wasn’t being directly attacked by Gamergate’s mob stuck their fingers in their ears and tried to pretend it wasn’t happening. Media outlets, game developers and publishers alike, perhaps motivated by a fear of making things worse or of alienating what they feared was a sizeable part of their audience, failed to speak out in defence of women until it was too late, if they spoke out at all. IGN, then the most popular games website in the world, published a stunningly weak exercise in both-sidesism about “recent unpleasantness” that failed to even call the movement by name.
The games industry’s failure to speak out decisively did not calm the situation. Doing nothing did not dissuade the mob. It merely left people, who were in some cases being harassed out of their homes and workplaces, feeling alone, furious and often afraid. Back then the main targets were female developers, journalists and critics. This time, it’s a group of narrative consultants.
In the 10 years since Gamergate, the culture wars that were fermented in gamer forums have spread out to poison almost all aspects of our lives . The last decade has taught us that these people will not simply go away: there may always be those who believe that the mere presence of women and minorities in their video games, or their Star Wars, or their halls of cultural or political power, is an affront, a symptom of the “woke mind virus”.
But we have also learned that ignoring them does not help. It only makes things worse. The people working at Sweet Baby should not be left to suffer on behalf of the studios that employ them. Individual developers are braver these days about speaking out on social media: the director of Alan Wake 2 posted that conspiracy theories claiming Sweet Baby forced the developer to change a character’s ethnicity were “absolutely not true”; and Mary Kenney, associate narrative director at Marvel’s Spider-Man developer Insomniac Games, has also Tweeted strong denials . But companies themselves need to follow suit. Publishers and developers that have worked with Sweet Baby Inc include Warner Bros Games and PlayStation’s Santa Monica Studio. Where are their statements of support? Are they going to publicly defend the people they worked with on multimillion-dollar games from false accusations, or let the trolls control the narrative?
Nobody is forcing diversity into video games. It is happening naturally, as players and developers themselves diversify. Gamergate didn’t intimidate women out of video games 10 years ago, and we won’t be intimidated now. The games industry knows that a greater breadth of content, featuring a greater breadth of characters, made with the contributions of a greater breadth of people, is good for creativity and for business, no matter what some aggrieved gamers may think. This time, it must make its support perfectly and unequivocally clear.

Macron says battle for abortion rights is not over as France updates constitution
In an emotional ceremony marking the enshrining of the right to an abortion in the French constitution, Emmanuel Macron said the historic change was the sealing of a long battle for “freedom, a fight made up of tears, tragedies and broken destinies”.
He said the occasion was a reminder of “the fate of generations of women deprived of the most intimate of choices: whether or not to have a child”.
“The destiny of these women, their suffering, their fear, the addresses exchanged under the cloak, of clandestine operations, of stifled cries, of impossible recoveries, of secrecy, of suspicions, of sermons, of the risk of losing everything, one’s happiness and one’s life,” he added.
“Yes, for too many years, women’s destinies were sealed by others. Their lives captured, their freedom scorned.”
The historic amendment was marked by an official sealing of the constitution using a 19th-century press that was installed outside the justice ministry in central Paris so the ceremony could be seen by the public.
There was applause among the crowd of dignitaries, politicians and celebrities as well as the public, as the justice minister, Éric Dupond-Moretti, flanked by Macron and the prime minister, Gabriel Attal, turned the 300kg manual press to stamp the amendment.
In his address, Macron said he wanted the measure inscribed in the EU charter of fundamental rights and that it should become a universal right.
“Today’s not the end of the story, it’s the beginning of a combat. If France has become the only country in the world whose constitution explicitly protects the right to an abortion in all circumstances, we will not rest until this promise is kept throughout the world. We will wage this battle on our continent, in our Europe , where reactionary forces first and always attack women’s rights, before going on to attack the rights of minorities, of all the oppressed, of all freedoms,” he warned.
On International Women’s Day, Macron chose to express the country’s recognition of 10 women, including Olympe de Gouges, a social reformer who wrote the “declaration of the rights of women and female citizens” in 1791; Simone Veil, a former health minister who introduced a 1975 law legalising abortion in France; and the singer and actor Josephine Baker.
MPs and senators who make up the French parliament voted to enshrine abortion as a constitutional right at a joint session at the Palace of Versailles on Monday. Of the 925 parliamentarians eligible to vote, 780 supported the amendment that gives women the “guaranteed freedom” to choose an abortion.
The measure had already been passed by the upper and lower houses, the Sénat and the Assemblée Nationale, but final approval by parliamentarians at the joint session at Versailles was needed to effect constitutional change.
The law will come into force on Saturday, when it is published in the Official Journal.

The Women’s prize for fiction is a success – now it has a nonfiction sister
G loria Steinem said: “The story of women’s struggle for equality belongs to no single feminist nor to any one organisation but to the collective efforts of all who care about human rights.” The key then, for all of us trying to make the world a better place for women, is not to complain but to act.
I am celebrating this International Women’s Day in the same week that my own initiative to promote women’s equality, the Women’s prize for fiction, announced its longlist, and in the same year that we launched the inaugural Women’s prize for nonfiction.
When I co-founded the Women’s prize in 1996, the impetus came from a shortlist announcement from a major literary prize in 1991 that had no female authors on it at all, compounding a growing awareness of the lack of respect for writing by women. That, in itself, is not necessarily a problem – judges have the right to choose the six books that they feel most embody the spirit of the prize they are judging, however the cards fall. The issue was that nobody noticed. Many of us working in publishing, bookselling, libraries, newspapers, asked ourselves what would have happened if they had put out a shortlist of all women. Everybody would have seen that as political, whereas the absence of women was seen as, simply, just how it was. It was clear that publishing was no less hidebound than any other industry and a little research revealed that fewer than 9% of authors shortlisted for major literary awards were women, despite being responsible for 60% of the novels published in the UK. Women were getting smaller advances, though their books performed just as well – or better – and novels by men were multiple times more likely to be reviewed. It wasn’t a conspiracy; it was an industry that was slow to evolve.
Creating the Women’s prize for fiction wasn’t easy. We were entrepreneurs with an idea and we needed – and still need – investment. Over the last 29 years, thanks to our sponsors, partners, patrons and donors, an entire generation of readers and writers and publishers has grown up knowing that the prize is out there, boosting visibility, celebrating originality, accessibility and excellence, and ultimately working towards gender equality in the world of books.
And as of 2024, it isn’t only about fiction. This year, for the first time, we are delighted to be awarding a Women’s prize for nonfiction, which has long been a goal. Our motivation was similar to the imbalance that frustrated us – and ultimately inspired us – back in 1991. According to Nielsen Bookscan, during 2022 there were four weeks when the entire Top 10 bestselling nonfiction hardbacks were written (or ghostwritten) by male authors, despite many exceptional books by women being published during that period: books about science and nature, history and recollection, art and AI, travel and belonging, physics and philosophy. Some number crunching revealed that 75% of nonfiction books reviewed in the British media were authored by men, despite the ratio of male-female writers being around about equal.
The Women’s prize represents and advocates, now more than ever, since we became a registered charity six years ago. We insist that women’s writing deserves an equal status – not more, not less, but equal. There is room for all. Many times, over the last three decades, I have advised others – men and women – setting up their own competitions and prizes, each with their own rules and focus. Because prizes matter, they put quality writing in the hands of women and men who will appreciate it. And we will continue to celebrate, to promote and engage because, as Margaret Atwood memorably put it: “A word after a word after a word is power.”

I’ve travelled the world researching patriarchy – and found it is far from inevitable
I n 1932, 75-year-old socialist Clara Zetkin stood in Germany’s Reichstag and, despite being so unsteady that she had to be carried into the building on a stretcher, managed to give a rousing speech lasting more than 40 minutes. “The fight of the labouring masses,” she declared, is “the fight for their full liberation.” She wasn’t a fan of feminism (dismissing it as bourgeois), but it was Zetkin’s dream that women everywhere, especially the most deprived and marginalised, might one day be free of all forms of oppression. The Nazis took power in Germany shortly after. Zetkin fled to Russia and died there.
On the day I went to see Zetkin’s former home north of Berlin in Brandenburg, now a museum, there were no other visitors. Despite her iconic status in her own time, she has been largely lost to history. Her bravery is remembered usually as a footnote to the fact that she helped found what we now know as International Women’s Day.
We can only guess at what Zetkin might have made of how pitifully watered-down International Women’s Day has become. For all its revolutionary beginnings, today it’s more about empowerment brunches in corporate meeting rooms, or women on minimum wage serving pink cupcakes to women in expensive suits outraged at why the Barbie movie didn’t win more awards. It’s mainstream. So mainstream that the Conservative party, while it calculates how to fly vulnerable refugees, many of them women , to Rwanda, wishes women everywhere a happy International Women’s Day . Even the Labour party has sacrificed bold idealism for a don’t-rock-the-boat centre ground in which nothing really changes except for the tone.
As the cupcake icing melts in our mouths, we forget that women like Zetkin once believed that wholesale change was possible. It’s a strange state we find ourselves in when we consider that most of human history has in fact been about social experimentation. As far back as we have records, people have been trying out different modes of living, testing out democracy and farming, knocking down powerful leaders when they became despotic, branching off to form new communities, sometimes across continents and oceans. Sometimes these attempts have failed; other times, they’ve stuck. But they all prove how remarkably versatile we are as a species, capable of inventing countless forms of social organisation.
As I learned on my travels while researching the origins of patriarchy , anthropologists have documented at least 160 matrilineal societies still in existence today, in which people trace their lineage through the women in their family rather than the men. There is an entire “ matrilineal belt ” that stretches across Africa, and others dotted across Asia and North and South America.
In her book The Kingdom of Women , the former corporate lawyer Choo WaiHong has described women in the matrilineal Mosuo community of south-west China as having “a self-assurance that comes from deep within” – the result of living in what she calls a “feminist utopia”. Grandfathers change nappies. Grandmothers have six-packs. Tiplut Nongbri, a retired academic who grew up in a matrilineal society in the Khasi Hills of India, told me that Khasi women divorce and remarry more often than women in the rest of the country, and have more freedom and agency. Kristen Ghodsee, author of Everyday Utopia , has catalogued countless alternative societies around the world, including matriarchal ecovillages in Colombia.
Some of these communities have traditionally worshipped goddesses. Some subvert patriarchal notions of gender and sexuality, transcending the binary. Some don’t have monogamous marriage, or even marriage at all in the way it is commonly understood elsewhere. In many, individuals live out their days in their ancestral mothers’ homes, raising children communally.
They exist on the very same planet as the rest of us. Yet, suggest alternatives such as these to anyone in today’s big states and you would probably be laughed out the door. We have become so terrified of change that many of us can’t even imagine living like others whose world we share. A myth has taken root that patriarchy is how things were originally, everywhere in the world. Last year, the feminist icon Taylor Swift told Time magazine as much. “What has existed since the dawn of time?” she said. “A patriarchal society.”
Nothing could be less true. Not only are patriarchies a relatively recent human invention – appearing in an incipient form between 7,000 and 5,000 years ago, taking millennia to develop into what we recognise them as in the modern age – they’re not universal even today.
Of course, the mainstreaming of feminism is a welcome shift in many ways. Women are acquiring or already have the same legal status and rights as men in many countries. It’s harder for modern patriarchal states such as Iran and Afghanistan to maintain their legitimacy. But at the same time, more radical possibilities seem to have fallen off the table, such as the idea that household work might be paid, or carried out by trained teams of well-equipped workers employed by the state, as the activist Angela Davis once suggested. Few seriously question the nuclear family, or raise the prospect of abolishing marriage as an institution. We seem decades away from redesigning infrastructures and institutions to safely make space for everyone, including non-binary and transgender people. If the Labour party cares about gender equality, when it comes into power it could transform women’s lives at a stroke by radically reducing income inequality between the rich and the poor. Instead, the party remains in thrall to society’s wealthiest .
Clara Zetkin’s vision for a post-patriarchal future was never about women having the same as men and everything else staying the same. It was about resetting society, inventing one without need, in which nobody suffered unnecessarily. She stood up to the Nazis in defence of that hope. We would do well to honour her, not with cupcakes, but with imagination.

Australian women are chalking up some wins in the workplace – yet our male leaders remain out of touch
T his International Women’s Day, ladies, put out your cupcakes for the 9-to-5 white collar working week. Recent changes to Australia’s industrial relations laws and public sector bargaining agreements suggest we just might be achieving some real progress towards more gender-equal workplace structures – and the blokes who have run the economy for the last 150 years are having a collective fit of the vapours.
First came the “right to disconnect” legislation as part of the government’s agreement with the Greens to pass the closing loopholes bill. This, according to the business lobby , will “kill” workplace flexibility. Apparently, if workers don’t want to answer their telephones or respond to emails when they are having dinner with their families or reading bedtime stories, they can forget about going to the dentist or picking the kids up from school, because “flexibility cuts both ways”.
Really? Tell that to the hundreds of thousands of workers who have worked permanent shifts on casual contracts for years, or to parents who have been forced back to the office after finally achieving some semblance of a work-life balance in the wake of Covid lockdowns.
So who is really out of touch here?
Last week’s data from the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) revealing the real gender pay gap in Australia’s largest companies showed that a huge part of the reason women suffer an income penalty of up to 30% compared with men is that the big money goes to those who can outsource their unpaid domestic work to others (almost always their wives) and work long hours in the office in a full-time role. That’s how you climb the ladder to senior roles in the “white collar” industries that pay high salaries.
A vast proportion of women don’t even try to work in offices once their children come along. Despite more Australian women than men now graduating from university, they still make up the majority of workers in the grossly underpaid and casualised retail, hospitality and care workforces, as these are the jobs that can most easily be fit in around the domestic work and care responsibilities that still fall overwhelmingly to women in heterosexual partnered households.
When women do work in offices on a 9-to-5 schedule, they are much less likely to be promoted to management and executive roles, primarily because they “choose” to work part time. This choice, of course, is due to the fact that schools operate from 9am to 3.30pm and women are still the most likely to be doing the drop-offs and pick-ups. They are also more likely to do the grocery shopping, cook meals, do laundry and take on the mental load of running a household. And as they get older, they are the ones who take time out again to care for ageing parents or other family members who are sick or disabled.
Do the men running most of Australia’s businesses get this? Do they even understand the contribution women make to the economy?
Comments by the business lobby about “those who have no choice but to be at work – truck drivers, plumbers, teachers, paramedics, factory workers, chefs, doctors” suggest not. Other than teaching, every one of those professions is dominated by men. Women often choose teaching because it fits with their kids’ school hours. They don’t “choose” the other jobs in this list because the structure of those workplaces makes it impossible for them to look after their families.
Yet more evidence that the highly paid men who dominate both business and our economic discourse utterly fail to consider the needs of women came in an astonishing piece by former deputy chief medical officer of Australia Nick Coatsworth this week. Working from home, he said, is “likely to be bad for your health” because it leads to more stress and a sedentary lifestyle – no walking or cycling to and from the office or the train, less movement while working because you only have to get up to go to the toilet, and you can’t exercise at home on company time.
Again, who is out of touch here? Any working woman with responsibilities at home will tell you we don’t have time to walk or cycle to work – we have to drop the kids on the way to and from the office, so we are rushing, often in the car. When we do work at home, we get up from our desks multiple times a day to put on a load of washing or unload the dishwasher or greet the grocery delivery driver at the front door. (Each of these tasks, by the way, takes five minutes: less than you’d spend on the “water cooler chat” that Coatsworth thinks so valuable.)
As for time to exercise, don’t make me laugh. There’s a multitude of evidence showing that women don’t exercise because they don’t have the time, and if they get any time, they are too exhausted after pulling a double shift – one in the office and one at home.
The UN theme for International Women’s Day this year is “Invest in women: accelerate progress”. If the stale, pale males who represent the interests of big business and employers in this country can’t keep up with the long-overdue progress in workplace practices that is finally under way then, frankly, we’ll all be better off when they accelerate into retirement.

The joy and freedom of a solo holiday as an older woman
Thank you for Joanna Moorhead’s wonderful article on solo travel ( Long lunches, casual friendships, no one to worry about: solo holidays are brilliant for older women like me, 5 March ). I’m on my first ever solo holiday, after 52 years of marriage. When I arrived in Vietnam, the guide who met me asked: “Why are you travelling alone?” I felt taken aback, but gather that this type of direct question is a cultural norm.
Much travelled but always with family, I feared that I might feel melancholy. Far from it. Apart from my itinerary, which was planned with a travel agent, I’ve felt liberated by doing what I wanted, without worrying about everyone else.
Vietnam is a fascinating country with a turbulent history to spice things up. Sightseeing has been refreshingly different. Visits to a series of mausoleums may seem grim, but far from it. These ornate, diverse complexes near Hue reflect each emperor’s unique personality. The only problem I’ve encountered is mansplaining – on long-haul flights and in restaurants.
Why am I alone? My husband has severe frontotemporal dementia. Of course, my thoughts turn to our excellent holidays together, but those days are gone and I’m lucky that, for me, still working hard and earning, carer’s respite can be exotic. I look forward to getting back to see him. Meanwhile, don’t hesitate, sisters – go travel! Rosalind Duhs London
I recently spent a month travelling solo in Italy and it was one of the most rewarding things I’ve ever done. Women over 50 are more than able when it comes to navigating transport issues, meeting new people and experiencing new challenges. Many doubt themselves and worry that they’ll be lonely, but there is a fantastic world out there waiting to be explored.
With translation apps, some basic phrases and a dose of common sense, you can travel easily, and once you’ve travelled with partners, family and friends, it is such a joy to do things like this for yourself.
I never felt alone and I found Deborah Ives’ Facebook group Solo in Style , mentioned in your article, so empowering – always supportive, with great practical advice and a good kick up the backside when needed (when I lost a bag and felt very sorry for myself).
You meet amazing people when travelling alone and can change your plans at a moment’s notice. You also learn to dig deep and realise that you have resilience and abilities that you never thought you had. Janice Falconer Falkirk, Stirlingshire
In my late 20s, I travelled solo around Brazil by bus. I bought a one-way ticket, and returned three years later. When I tell people this, nobody bats an eyelid. But now, in my 50s with a grownup son and the same sense of wanderlust I had three decades ago, if I mention that I’m going to Mexico for a month, or have just returned from a trip to Cuba alone, I seem to get a response from women of my age of either horror or awe: “What, on your own?”
Yes, always – my time, my itinerary. A last-minute ticket to the theatre, people-watching at pavement cafes, a book and picnic in the park, eating what I want when I want, an impromptu afternoon of live music and beer, galleries and museums, and a flea market – always a flea market. No people-pleasing, no negotiating. When I do want company, what could be better than striking up a conversation in a cafe or gallery, or booking myself on to a local cooking course or a small tour? I travel alone, but I am never lonely.
I was once in a restaurant at lunchtime with my mother, where there was a woman sitting alone – a traveller, engrossed in a book, she had a couple of glasses of wine, a main course and a dessert, and some chitchat with the waiter. I must admit I was a little envious. I wondered what she had planned for an afternoon alone in London.
Later that day, my mother, who hates being alone, said: “Did you notice that poor woman on her own at lunchtime? I felt so sorry for her.” I guess it’s all about perception. Sam Menezes Newington Green, London
Age does not need to be a barrier to travel if you can still get about. In February 2020, I went on a trip to Morocco when I was 92. I use a walker for fractures in my back, but I can walk quite fast and had no problem keeping up with the tour group. On the first morning in Marrakech, I overslept and found that the tour had already left, so I got a taxi and followed their itinerary in the hope of catching up with them. In fact, they had missed their planned visit to one of the most impressive palaces. I went round it (free, when they saw my walker) and then walked on my own to a shopping street, to be dazzled by the mounds of colourful spices and the gorgeous silks in the clothing shops.
It was useful to speak a bit of French for asking directions, but I had no trouble finding a taxi back to the hotel, where our kind and competent tour guide invited me to lunch because he felt bad at having left me behind. Excursions to the Marjorelle Gardens, the Atlas mountains and Essaouira caused no problems. I had worried that no one would want to socialise with someone as old as me, but I was lucky enough to find an interesting group aged about 50 to 75 who would meet for drinks before and after dinner, and were quite prepared to chat.
I was even saved from the ultimate holiday disaster of losing my wallet by the quick-thinking tour guide. I had not noticed it fall out of my bag while I was taking a photo by a stream in a Bedouin village. A small boy selling beads picked it up and handed it to our guide.
It was only a six-day tour, but we said goodbye with regret. Morocco is a fascinating country with plenty of landscapes to look at, a tradition of superb workmanship and a cuisine that is both Arab and French: tagines and patisserie. A coach tour there was a great experience and perfectly feasible at 92. Jennifer Wells Lewes, East Sussex
I am reading the feature about solo holidays on a rare day when my toddler is in nursery and I am not snowed under with work (or rather, I probably am, but am ignoring it). The article feels like the dreamy promise of a very distant future that might never happen. For those parents who, like me, can only dream of an actual holiday, may I suggest skiving off work occasionally for a solo lunch (me, just now – toast slathered with mayonnaise and tomato – good enough to pass for tapas), a solo walk, a solo trip to the cinema? If you half close your eyes and put your phone away, it almost feels like freedom.
The ironic thing is that I did go on the odd solo adventure in a past life and had to fight hard to get over the loneliness of it. Oh, how I would love my loneliness back. It puts me in mind of a line from Rainer Maria Rilke’s Letters to a Young Poet: “ Love your solitude ”. Name and address supplied
I’m married to someone who does not fly, so I took the plunge at solo travel nearly 20 years ago and have never looked back. Argentina, Antarctica and the Iguazu Falls were ticked off my bucket list. The terror of dining alone in Buenos Aires was dispelled by taking a book – no mobile phones in those days.
Wherever I travel in the world, there are helpful and friendly people, so don’t be afraid to ask. The Galápagos Islands were so much better on a small boat than a cruise, and viewing Machu Picchu from the Sun Gate, having walked the last part of the trail, was incredible.
At 77 years of age, I depart next week to tick off Chile’s Atacama desert and Easter Island. So I say, go for it – what have you got to lose? Andrea Stow Cleckheaton , West Yorkshire
Joanna Moorhead’s article resonated with me. Unable to afford solo travel when a young student, I began to travel within Europe in my 60s – single again and with adult children and grandchildren.
I deliberately chose smaller cities with art galleries and museums that drew me, eg Porto for the Serralves museum, Málaga for the Picasso museum etc. Below is a poem that I wrote in situ that perhaps speaks to this issue. Gillie Harries Bristol
Restaurante Avero, Porto 14.03.2018
I eat alone You are alone? The charming maitre d’ asks. Yes, for now, alone I respond. I sit, Giselle has slammed Her fury over the city, Beside the plate glass window A bowl of sopa fava warms My chill constitution I overlook the garden Of Virtudes A virtuous quiet exciting Lunch for one: Clean vinho verdhe Olives bread oil Painted with the ombre Of balsamic A solitary woman At peace, Perhaps like the American Or French woman seated before me Her back says She is enjoying This feasting also Bom Dia. A nacreous light Fades up from the Atlantic coast Along the rifled Douro. A yellow crane Moves its load Minutely, safely As we women are Now permitted Lone movement. The change, the shift; Carefully, slowly Safely. Aptly, on gazing up And this being a gallery, The black painted outline Of a bold female, faces Down the room Her eyes contest The space And a tree branches Clear from her cranium Knowledge, and solidarity Saint of lone women Diners, We have come of age. No longer pray for us.

We must address the shocking gender gap at global financial institutions
In advance of International Women’s Day, your timely piece on the World Bank’s new report finding no equality for working women in any country ( 5 March ) was a stark reminder of the work left ahead. However, it’s important ask whether there is equality for working women at the World Bank itself, or any of the seven major international financial institutions (IFIs) that my colleagues and I studied in 2023.
At the time we found that, though the share of women in leadership at these important institutions has doubled in the last two decades, not a single IFI had reached gender parity in its management ranks. Since the study was released, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has achieved gender parity in management – which is to say that only one IFI has achieved this at any point in time. It’s also worth noting that gender equality gains are easily reversed and prone to periods of stagnation.
Most IFIs recognise the essential role women must play in development, and have put forth robust gender strategies. The World Bank places the engagement of female leaders as one of three strategic objectives. Yet only two out of nine IFIs have a female head; and no woman of colour has ever been the head of an IFI. Their boards of directors are even further from parity than the managerial positions filled by technocratic ranks.
It’s important that these institutions, collectively responsible for more than a quarter of a trillion dollars of lending in 2022, lead by example. They should do it because it’s right, and central to their work. Closing the gender gap has been labelled “ macrocritical ”: essential to economic growth, financial stability, and lower income inequality.
As we ask what more can be done for gender equality this International Women’s Day, we must also look at the role we all can and should play. Eeshani Kandpal Senior fellow, Center for Global Development , Washington DC; former senior economist, World Bank

Empowering female cotton farmers could boost climate resilience
Women in rural areas experience systematic inequality, and climate change is widening the gender gap ( Financial toll of climate crisis hitting women harder, UN says, 5 March ). In global cotton production, for example, women are a significant contributor, but their work is labour-intensive and undervalued. They disproportionately shoulder the burden of the farm and domestic work while gender norms limit their inheritance rights and access to finance, training and the markets.
Inequalities in cotton farming remain a pressing challenge, but also a missed opportunity. Supporting female farmers to be more gainfully involved in value chains can increase yields and economic gain. Training in climate-smart farm practices can also support them in mitigating the effect of catastrophic weather.
While businesses and social enterprises cannot change policies and social norms overnight, we can help break the cycle by providing tailored support for women around sustainable farming. Apparel companies can start by equipping female farmers in their supply chains with more sustainable practices such as crop diversification to promote climate resilience and output.
Furthermore, we need to unleash rural women’s potential beyond farming through financial and health awareness programmes. It helps create a ripple effect that benefits not only female farmers, but also their children and communities. As observed by our Women in Cotton research, women receiving such support report increased self-esteem and confidence, higher household living standards and investment in children’s education, health benefits and improved social standing.
The UN data is a stark reminder of how social, economic and environmental issues are intrinsically linked. This week’s International Women’s Day is an opportunity to remind all of us in the apparel industry that supporting women in the cotton supply chain secures benefits that go beyond the farm, contributing to a more ethical and sustainable sector. Alison Ward CEO, CottonConnect

Prison is no place for vulnerable young women
The image of a girl in a children’s prison being pinned down and stripped by male officers, not once but on two separate occasions, beggars belief ( Girl at YOI Wetherby was twice stripped by male officers, watchdog says, 5 March ). This is a horrific story that cannot be ignored. The “highly vulnerable” girl with complex needs, we are told by the chief inspector of prisons, was routinely self-harming, yet no plan was in place for female staff to be available.
Put bluntly, a bad situation was made worse by imprisonment, where those responsible for a teenage girl’s care put her in increased harm’s way. This is a child in need of support, not traumatisation and wholly inappropriate treatment in a prison. The idea that a vulnerable girl in distress faces force and degrading trauma as a means of “protection” should shock us to our core. It triggers flashbacks of the strip-search incident in a school with Child Q .
Agenda Alliance’s recent work has found that young women are at the highest risk of self-harm of all women in prison. Once inside, trauma is embedded into an environment designed and staffed for men and boys, while ignoring that women and girls need an entirely different approach. Take Ruby, a victim of domestic abuse before prison: “My only coping mechanism was to turn to what I had known throughout my life, ‘pain’. So that’s what I did, inflicted pain on myself.”
Let’s stop looking the other way. While men’s prisons are bursting at the seams, we must not turn a blind eye to the overlooked minority of girls and young women who are imprisoned. We have to call time on locking up vulnerable girls and young women in prisons that harm them. It’s time to invest in trauma-informed community solutions. The government knows these are vital.

Somalia to launch its first current affairs TV show led by women
Somalia’s only all-female media team, Bilan, is launching the country’s first TV current affairs show to be hosted by a woman.
The debate show will also be the first programme on Somali television to have a panel of at least 50% women, and the first to broach contentious topics, such as a critical shortage of female teachers and the challenges faced by women trying to get into politics, as well as environmental issues.
Launching on International Women’s Day, 8 March, the monthly programme will be similar in format to the UK’s BBC Question Time, touring venues around the country and inviting audience members to take part. It follows a successful pilot in December when the panel debated period education in schools.
Reaction to the pilot was overwhelmingly positive, said the host, Naima Said Salah, and exposed the impact that a dire lack of information had on girls. “One young woman in the audience shared her own experience. She remembered the exact time and day when her period started because she had no idea what was happening. She thought she was dying. It was only after she told her older sister, that she understood,” said Salah, a senior reporter at Bilan.
Salah added that she was proud to bring the subject of periods into public debate. “Women, including me, never had the opportunity to learn about periods as girls; even our own mums don’t discuss it. People think this is taboo, but it is a fact; it exists and we cannot ignore it.”
Cabdulqaadir Maxamed Xasan, the director of the Mogadishu schools network, was pleased . “Given the scarcity of female teachers in the education sector, young girls often struggle during their periods to adapt to changing circumstances. This discussion underscored the importance of community support during this critical time, particularly at the onset of adolescence.”
Bilan was established in 2022 with support from the United Nations Development Programme, with six journalists led by Nasrin Mohamed Ibrahim , one of the few female senior news producers in the country. It is based in the capital, Mogadishu, at Dalsan media, one of Somalia’s largest media organisations. After receiving EU funding for the next three years it plans to expand into federal states in 2024, recruiting 20 new journalists and offering grants for investigative reports to a further 10.
Somalia’s media sector is male-dominated, with a strong focus on politics. All six founding members of Bilan have faced discrimination and harassment in their careers. The project was set up to offer women a safe space to tell the stories they wanted to tell, and has covered a wide range of under-reported stories, including Somalis living with HIV, child abuse and postnatal depression .
“One reason why women’s stories are rarely told in the Somali media is that most reporters are men. Bilan will change that,” said Ibrahim at the time. “Women will speak to us because we too are women. They will allow us into their homes, their prayer rooms and their private spaces.”

Behind the fanfare of James Cleverly’s visit to Sierra Leone, the need to restore aid is starkly apparent
I n the lush garden of the British High Commission in Sierra Leone, the UK foreign secretary James Cleverly addressed a gathering of mostly female politicians, campaigners and entrepreneurs: “You cannot have a successful country without successful women. The future of this country rests on the shoulders of strong, powerful women. You are the future of this country.”
It was International Women’s Day and Cleverly’s speech last week was the culmination of a whistlestop tour of his late mother’s birthplace. Earlier that day he had been welcomed to the southern city of Bo, the second largest in the country, by hundreds of people riding motorbikes and wearing T-shirts bearing the message: “The people of Bo Town warmly welcome Rt Hon James Cleverly.” Car horns were honked, schoolchildren and brass bands lined the road, and there were anxious radio exchanges between the official cars as Foreign Office staff worried about the delay to the tight schedule.
“It’s not often I’m lost for words but this has been an unbelievable honour and wonderful to be back home,” said Cleverly when he finally arrived at Bo government hospital, before being whisked off to tour the neonatal unit.
The family connection was one reason Cleverly chose Sierra Leone to launch a new global gender equality strategy, the first since the Foreign Office merged with the Department for International Development in 2020. “I think of her [his mother] all the time in the work we do which is why I took the decision to do it in the country of her birth,” he said.
The other reason was that Sierra Leone looks like a poster child for bilateral aid. As the climate crisis and conflict worsen inequalities around the world, and extremist governments brutally suppress women fighting for the most basic rights, here is a country making great strides, transitioning from having one of the worst records globally on women’s health, education and equality to taking widely praised steps to improve the lives of 52% of its population.
In partnership with Saving Lives in Sierra Leone , the FCDO’s leading health programme, the country has reduced maternal mortality rates from 1,165 per 100,000 in 2013 – the world’s highest – to 717 per 100,000 in 2019 . Health minister Dr Austin Demby said the ambition is “to be like Finland” – where the rate is among the world’s lowest.
In November president Julius Maada Bio announced that a quarter of the national budget would be allocated to education . That same month Bio told the UK House of Lords of his vision to “nurture the talents and … mine the full potential of every child in Sierra Leone”, especially girls.
The safe motherhood bill, which overturns colonial-era laws to extend access to abortion, was hailed by rights groups as a “landmark moment” .
In January, the Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment Act was seen as another groundbreaking step for rights in these areas. The law stipulates that women must make up 30% of employees in public and private organisations, and that 30% of candidates put forward by any political party for parliamentary and local elections must be female; it also enshrines improvements in women’s access to finance, employment opportunities, equal pay and maternity leave.
Glimpses of this progress were visible as Cleverly – whose mother trained as a midwife in the UK after leaving Sierra Leone – was ushered from the hospital to an Islamic school and later to a sustainable forestry company called Miro – all projects funded by UK aid. At the Islamic Call secondary school, in one of the poorest areas of the city, the pupils were eager to tell him about the school’s trailblazing zero-tolerance policy on gender-based violence, and how they have been encouraged to report any abuse they experienced. “I didn’t know flogging was violence,” said one teenager.
Filming himself surrounded by excited kids calling out the jobs they aspired to, Cleverly told his Twitter followers : “The UK, your money, supports projects like this, helping these young people develop, helping to educate … the future leaders – this makes such a difference.”
When the UK government circus comes to a place such as Bo, the mission is to capture these soundbites for social media, but casting a shadow over events is aid cuts. Even the projects selected to demonstrate the difference aid makes are not immune.
Saving Lives lost about 50% of its funding in 2022, according to Flaviour Nhawu, a public health specialist for the International Rescue Committee (IRC), forcing the group to scale back their work – including a reduction in family planning outreach teams and community engagement work.
As Cleverly stood in the playground highlighting the benefits of UK aid, the juniors principal of the school , Janet Howafai, said the support only extends to learning materials and transport for teachers to attend training sessions. The school has nowhere near enough money to build on the work it has started. “We are happy to receive him”, Howafai said of the visit, “but we want to ask him to provide funding.
“There are a lot of constraints, even the building isn’t enough for us. We need a room for mentors to talk to girls in private. We need a fence to improve security. Even sanitary towels – girls are using native pads.”
A lack of money is hardly surprising. A £4.2bn cut in British aid in 2021 – including slashing its contribution to the UN population fund, UNFPA, by 85% (providing 40% of the world’s contraception) – has had a devastating impact globally , bringing accusations the government is abandoning women.
The overall budget has been further diminished by the decision to allow the Home Office to raid the overseas aid pot to support refugees in the UK , shortchanging the world’s poorest people, according to a report by the international development committee (IDC) earlier this month. “The haemorrhaging of funds from the FCDO’s budget to the Home Office is robbing Peter to pay Paul,” said Sarah Champion, the committee chair.
On the same day Cleverly was promoting his plan in Sierra Leone to “put women and girls at the heart of our international work”, the IDC was launching another inquiry, this time into how cuts have affected sexual and reproductive health programmes in lower-income countries.
The IRC also launched a report – Why Wait? – calling on the government to restore funding. “The lack of funding to women’s rights and women-led organisations is an alarming oversight that disenfranchises women’s voices, capacities, leadership, and agency,” said Inah Kaloga, the senior director of violence response and protection at the IRC.
All of which raises the question: how will the new strategy, launched with such fanfare, be funded?
Cleverly doesn’t like that query. Speaking exclusively to the Guardian in Freetown, he declined to put a figure on the plan.
“It’s the wrong question,” he said. “The point is, it’s not about inputs, it’s about outputs. The hospital facility [in Bo] we were at, we’ve had to reduce our direct bilateral funding, but we are working to ensure that project continues by leveraging in money from the World Bank and US Aid . It’s making sure the outputs continue – and one key output was the reduction in child mortality. It’s not about our bilateral input, it’s about their ability to deliver.”
He went on to say the fact that the reduction in overseas development aid (ODA) expenditure had had an impact was proof that aid could make a difference. “If we were saying that we could reduce ODA expenditure without having any detrimental impact, by definition it would mean much of that expenditure wasn’t making a difference.”
“Diplomacy” and “creative” approaches were also key to plugging development gaps, he said.
“I can’t make more money. We’ve got the constraints we’ve got … until that economic envelope gives me more money, we’ve got to box clever. What I’m saying to people across the [government’s development] network – slightly unfairly I know – is that I’m asking them to work even smarter still, be really innovative and really creative.”
ODA will return to the UN-recommended 0.7% – the Conservatives controversially slashed it to 0.5% in 2021 – he said, though not when, “and the best practice we’re baking into the system will mean that when that money does come back on stream we can use it even more effectively”.
A second round of sanctions against individuals who perpetuate sexual violence , announced at the same time, are another tool in the fight against growing threats against women, Cleverly said. “The message I want to send to people who abuse women around the world is we’re watching and we’re going to come after you.”
The FCDO also launched a new £38m programme to support women’s rights organisations globally, with about £650,000 to be spent in Sierra Leone.
The death of a two-year-old during Cleverly’s visit was a stark reminder of the desperate need to fund grassroots activism. While the cause of death has not been confirmed, campaigners against female genital mutilation believe the girl bled to death after being cut. FGM is often performed by secret female societies . According to reports the police intercepted one of the societies as they buried the child.
Rugiatu Turay, an anti-FGM campaigner and founder of the Amazonian Initiative Movement (AIM), was among those present at the British High Commission reception. She said any strategy seeking to address violence against women must include ending FGM: “FGM is the missing link. FGM links to wider violence against women such as early marriage and maternal deaths.”
Decades of campaigning in Sierra Leone have had some impact: awareness is higher and some communities have agreed to alternative, non-harmful ceremonies, but the rate of FGM is still 86% – and the proposed child rights law stops short of banning the practice. Instead it will introduce 18 as the age of consent for FGM, a controversial notion.
“Their argument is that women have the right to make decisions over their bodies, but how can I consent to hurt my body?” said Turay.
Also at the event were others who challenged the idea that Sierra Leone is making progress.
Dr Nemata Majeks-Walker founded the 50/50 Group of Sierra Leone , which encourages women’s participation in politics, and is scathing about the gender equality bill: “I’m so angry about it. We have been fighting about [fair representation] for years. The new law does not capture most of what we wanted. It’s lip service. By now we should be 50% but they don’t want us to have their seats; they feel intimidated; they feel women will take their place.”
Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr, the mayor of Freetown, who announced on 6 March her intention to run for a second term, agreed. “This is a government that says and doesn’t do. There is a huge gap between rhetoric and reality – they are very good at making announcements. [But it is] a cynical exercise to meet international indexes and to check all the boxes.”
Aki-Sawyerr’s progressive policies, particularly on the climate crisis , have won her plaudits internationally, but in Sierra Leone she has been harassed, intimidated, falsely accused of inciting deadly protests last August and arrested. “They are obsessed with removing me from the political space. You could say I pose a threat – which is rooted in the fact that women are more development oriented and less likely to be involved in corruption.”
Femi Claudius Cole, the founder of the Unity party and the only female leader of a political party in Sierra Leone, has also been arrested over orchestrating protests and had her passport confiscated – she has yet to get it back.
Perhaps it was this disconnect, between Cleverly’s warm words and the reality of being a “strong, powerful woman” in Sierra Leone, that riled Cole as she listened to his speech. “It’s makeup on a disfigurement,” she said of the event.
“We have these functions where we dress up and attend and make polite conversation, when just beneath the surface things haven’t changed at all. At the end of such a lovely evening, what’s our takeaway?
“What are we doing to help the women who have no Facebook pages, no Twitter account, no access to a microphone, no media outlets to engage them … what are we doing?”

UK cost of living champions: women battling the crisis
F rom providing food and clothing for struggling families to offering financial advice and childcare, each of these women has helped change the lives of others in the toughest economic climate in a generation.
Named “cost of living champions” by Save the Children for refusing to stand by while the situation played out around them, they have demonstrated the transformative power of women in a crisis.
A group of talented female photographers have worked alongside the six champions to create a series of portraits that captures their work and spirit.
Gwen Hines, the chief executive of Save the Children, said: “Each woman is inspiring for the work they are doing and deserve their moment in the spotlight. Everything they do, often for little or no pay, is to make the lives of others easier. It seemed fitting to bring these women together with female photographers at the forefront of their field.”

Danielle and her mum, Michelle, founded AberNecessities child bank, which provides disadvantaged families with essential items from birth to the end of school.
“One in five children living in Aberdeen city and shire are living in poverty. Since launching in 2019, we have supported over 10,000 children across north-east Scotland. For me, this is a huge sign that we are needed and that AberNecessities is a vital service to our community – and we are very proud that we can help.
“Families are referred to us daily by the NHS, social work, the education system and fellow charities, and we provide everything a parent needs for a child growing up; from nappies and formula to clothing and beds for pregnant mums to children up to 18 years.
“This all came about as I am a specialist and early intervention teacher. I was meeting children who weren’t going to school because they didn’t have the most basic essentials. One teenager didn’t have a bra, another didn’t have shoes. It got to the point where I thought: ‘Why are we not able to just meet that need?’ So I started collecting pre-loved items that I’d store in my garage and do deliveries with my children in the car. Now, five years later, we’re a registered charity, with employed staff and volunteers, delivering much needed items to thousands of families.
Danielle and Michelle put together an Abernecessities birthday pack
“What keeps me going is the end result; a child opening a pack and that smile, that excitement, and that sense of relief a parent is getting. Moments like that are so important, for every family, for better mental health, your journey through motherhood, they’re absolutely priceless. We’re gifting those moments to other families.
“I am very proud to be a woman. I feel very proud to work with and for women and AberNecessities is a proudly women-led organisation which champions female empowerment. We’re strong, our bodies do amazing things. When we look at our children, we need to empower each other and make each other feel good about the fact that we’ve brought another life into the world.”

Leanna is deputy manager at Meadows nursery, a first-of-its-kind partnership between Sheffield Hallam University, Watercliffe Meadow school, Sheffield city council and Save the Children.
“We’re a nursery, but people say it feels like home. My door is always open and the kettle is always on! This area of Sheffield is quite deprived. Most of the children at our nursery are claiming free early learning entitlement [FEL]. There hasn’t been that provision here for nearly 10 years.
“We opened during the pandemic, which was difficult. We knew we needed to meet the community, so we literally walked the streets with flyers. Not many other nurseries would do that. We’ve achieved more in two years than I thought we would in five.
“My role is all about parental engagement. I feel passionately that we should support parents.
Leanna with IIya, who is visually impaired, at Meadow’s nursery
We’ve seen such growth from those who’ve attended workshops here. When they go home elated and empowered, it’s likely that their children are going to have a better day. We look at the whole family, and by doing that we’ve noticed it’s had a huge impact on the children’s development.
“The parents came up with the idea of a weekly breakfast club, which is now a huge part of the nursery. They wanted a warm, safe space to come, where they could meet other parents, and have something to eat – a place for their wellbeing.
“The cost-of-living crisis is massive and families are really struggling. Last week a parent said to me: ‘I’m going to get fed twice this week because you’re putting on a workshop and breakfast club.’ My heart just sank. Parents are feeding their children, but not themselves.
“I grew up on a council estate in Sheffield. My parents worked hard but really struggled, and I know what that feels like. It really made me want to better myself. I say to other parents: ‘If I can do it, you can do it too.’ I want mums to be proud of themselves, because raising children is the biggest job of all.
“The children here now are going to be the ones who change their lives and those of others in the future too. I feel really privileged to be part of that.
“This nursery isn’t just about me. It’s about all the staff, the families and the community. I couldn’t do it without them. I’ve been in other settings and turned down for other jobs, and when I look back now I think: ‘Ah-ha, that’s because I’m meant to be here, with these families.’”

Christine is a mother of three, a grandmother and a volunteer at Smallshaw Hurst Community Action Group Pantry Store, Ashton United In the Community Luncheon Club and Cedar Park Chefs.
“I came to this area 40 years go and never left. I help out at the food pantry where families can get £15 worth of shopping for £3 and a luncheon club for older people. I also work on recipes for families using a slow cooker and calculate exactly how much gas and electric it’s going to cost them to make. I volunteer in the community most days. I never stop, no rest for me!
Christine hugging Kelly, a Cook 4 Life participant, at her home in Greater Manchester
“Families at the moment are finding it really, really hard. Food, gas, electric, baby milk, nappies … They’re deciding whether they sit in the cold and eat and whether they sit in the warm and don’t get to eat anything. We’ve not seen poverty like this before, and some families on our estate are very low, but we have got a good community. They can knock on anybody’s door and we’ll look after them.
“If someone asks me for help, I’ll often suggest the food pantry. When it first opened, families wouldn’t come because of pride. Some thought they’d phone social services and some have mental health issues and won’t leave the house. I encouraged them to come and use the pantry and I even go and knock on their doors sometimes, saying: ‘I’m coming today, you be ready, and you come with me.’
Christine and Cook 4 Life participants outside the food pantry
“I enjoy trying to help families. Many of them feel like my family too now, because I’ve been here 40 years and they seem to come to me for everything. If they’ve got an issue with the council, or food, I’ll always put them in the right direction of where to go. There are 144 houses on our estate. I don’t always know the new ones who move in straight away, but I always go and say, ‘Hello, if you ever need anything, just give me a knock if I can help you out’.
“I think I started doing this work because I’d seen my mum do the same sort of thing. When we were little, my mum used to organise all the coach trips for where we lived – she was the one out there in the community. Now I’m trying to involve the next generation, my daughters, my friends. They think they can’t do it, but they’ve done amazing so far. They’ve got determination.”

Moni and Shuily met about 11 years ago at a women’s group on the Aberfeldy estate, where Shuily was volunteering. The pair are known to the community now for their involvement in multiple female-focused groups, and most recently the weekly healthy eating cooking classes they run together.
Moni and Shuily
The pair talked for a long time about wanting to share their culinary skills, and so a few years ago (they quibble over exactly how many) they set up their healthy eating cooking classes at the Aberfeldy neighbourhood centre in Tower Hamlets. Every Tuesday morning, they invite women from the area to attend.
Moni and Shuily cook together in front of the group, using a mini-oven and table-top hotplate, film their demo, then enjoy tasting the food with the group. Dishes range from Bengali to Italian. All recipes are simplified, in terms of ingredients and technique, with the aim of feeding a family for £5.
Shuily talks about how their classes are more important than ever since the advent of the cost of living crisis. They acknowledge how hard it is for families, and Shuily says: ’We’re doing our bit.’ The sessions are an opportunity for women in the community to seek help with all manner of issues, for Shuily and Moni to signpost them to other things, such as food banks or crisis grants. As Moni says: “It’s not just cooking – it’s so much more than that.”

Ingrid Hall runs the Well Bee-ing hub and cafe in Wallsend, North Tyneside and is a director of the Dreamshine Community Interest Company. She set up the community cafe and social enterprise with co-director Clare Haidari. The hub provides local people with somewhere to get a cup of tea and lunch at low cost, and support if needed.
They also run a befriending scheme, deliver prescriptions, do food shopping for those in need, and provide a place to pick up the Feeding Families emergency food boxes. Being well connected in their local community, they can signpost people to places where they can get support. They have also offered voluntary hours at the cafe to vulnerable people to help them get back into work.
Ingrid and Clare set up the hub to try to make the lives of people in their community easier. It’s been running for a couple of years and is well used by the local community. They often don’t draw a wage themselves, and work extremely long hours to make sure it can still function. They’re currently working to secure long-term funding and may expand into outside catering.

Nerys is a community support coordinator with Action in Caerau and Ely (ACE), a community development charity owned and run by residents based at the Dusty Forge.
“After being made redundant after 12 years working in banking, I retrained in health and social care, and I began volunteering here, then joined them as staff. I’m proud of being able to work in my own community, as it’s where my roots are. I think when you live in somewhere like Ely and Caerau, which is a deprived part of Wales, everybody makes assumptions about you. It’s really hurtful, because the vast majority are good, honest, hardworking people, and there’s a lot of untapped talent here. No community is perfect, but this community is perfect to me.
“I do think in a crisis women just roll up their sleeves and get on with things. A strong woman will also attract like-minded women or draw people in who are less strong, and build up those networks, bring people in and empower them to find solutions to what’s going on.
Nerys, 41, with Natasha, 40, who runs the cafe Barr at ACE
“I’ve been helping people with financial advice for a number of years, but since January, and in response to the cost of living crisis, we set up ‘Crisis Hour’. Every morning local families can come and see us for immediate access to things like food and fuel. We see about 50 households a week and we’ve helped about 2,500 households with fuel in the past few years.
“I had a lady come in yesterday morning and her hands were like ice. She had basically gone all weekend without any gas, which was really, really cold. She’d had to send her children to her mum’s house because she felt that she couldn’t meet their basic needs. She sat in front of me and was just so broken.
“I was able to offer vouchers and grants to help her, which is amazing that we’re able to offer that, but it’s just a sticking plaster, isn’t it? There’s massive concern as to what things will look like this spring when government energy support is withdrawn.
Nerys, 41, with volunteers at the ACE pantry. Families pay £5 a week and get a wide selection of fresh, frozen and store-cupboard food
“I feel very strongly that the cost of living crisis is robbing children of their childhood. They’re being exposed to things they have no business knowing. They don’t need to know that Mum can’t afford to put money in the electricity. They don’t need to know that Mum can’t afford for them to go on their school trip because she doesn’t get paid enough. Poverty is going to ruin the lives of these young people and they don’t deserve this.
“I don’t know what the answer to any of this is, but there’s power in numbers. It’s about sharing my own experiences and encouraging other people to do the same. Take away that shame and stigma.”

Sunak pledges to ‘build on legacy’ of Lionesses after schools commitment
It is the government’s job to build on the Lionesses’ legacy, the prime minister has said, hours after heeding the calls of the Women’s Euro 2022 champions and committing to providing girls with equal access to school sports.
Downing Street’s announcement of the measures came after a campaign launched by the team on the heels of their tournament win last summer, when players wrote an open letter calling on the then prime ministerial contenders, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, to invest in girls’ football in schools .
“That was something that the Lionesses campaigned rightly for. It’s something that I said over the summer I would deliver if I was prime minister, and I’m glad that today we are delivering on that promise,” Sunak said during a football session with young players and members of the national team at Downing Street on Wednesday.
Football Association figures published last July showed 72% of girls played as much football as boys in primary school but that the figure dropped to 44% in secondary school. It found that only 40% of secondary schools offered girls the same access to football via after-school clubs as boys.
Beth Mead, the BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2022 winner and star of the Lionesses’ triumph, said on Wednesday: “We’re passionate about a lasting legacy and the next generation of football, for girls especially.
“It’s exciting times ahead, and hopefully there’s girls who can take over from us and do even better.”
The new standards will make the same sports available to boys and girls, where wanted, and a minimum of two hours of PE a week up to the end of year 11. Over the next two years, more than £600m will be provided by the government to improve PE and sports in primary schools, in addition to up to another £57m to open more school sports facilities outside school hours.
For years the FA has taken strides to improve talent pathways to the national team and, more recently, to improve diversity . In the months after the team’s success, the Women’s Super League attendance was up 227% on the previous season, and England Football saw a 15% increase in female youth team participation from June to December. “Our job is to build on that legacy,” said Sunak.
The government’s commitment on International Women’s Day also coincided with an event for the FA’s #LetGirlsPlay campaign, which was launched in 2021 and is fighting for equal access to football in communities and schools by 2024.
The director of women’s football at the FA, Sue Campbell, has seen political support for the issue vary in the past, but she said the present government’s heeding a call for change from the women’s national team was a “massive statement” about its commitment.
Lady Campbell attended a #LetGirlsPlay football session on Wednesday morning with primary- and secondary-aged school girls, alongside the national team coach, Sarina Wiegman, and the former men’s team striker Ian Wright. In total, 200,000 girls took part in football sessions on Wednesday as part of the campaign.
“I still think we have hearts and minds to win about women’s football. I don’t think everyone thinks it’s a wonderful thing,” Campbell said.
“We’ve still got that job to do, that as the game evolves, and people see the quality of football and are inspired by it, we hope people will begin to accept it as the norm that women can and should play football at every level.”

International Women’s Day 2023: women defy protest ban with march in Pakistan – as it happened
About 2,000 women have rallied in the Pakistani city of Lahore despite efforts by authorities to bar the protest and withdraw security for an event frequently the target of violence, Al Jazeera reports .
Rallies on International Women’s Day have received fierce backlash since they were embraced four years ago in deeply conservative and patriarchal Pakistan.
On Tuesday, dozens of events marking International Women’s Day – known as the Aurat March in Pakistan – were held across the country.
Non-violent counterprotests, dubbed “hijab marches”, were also staged by women from conservative religious groups in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad where participants called for the preservation of Islamic values.
Our Pakistan correspondent Shah Meer Baloch explains that the Punjab government has banned all political rallies and gatherings before Aurat march (Women’s march) and former prime minister Imran Khan’s election campaign rally in Lahore.
Earlier the court had intervened to give permission to Aurat march in Lahore after the district administration had denied permission because of security reasons.
He reports there have been clashes between the activists and journalists and the police have intervened.
We’ll get more on that shortly.
I’m wrapping up the International Women’s Day blog from London for today, but you can keep up with all of our coverage of IWD on our dedicated page which will continue to be updated as the day continues around the world.

UN Women – who set this year’s theme as “ DigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality ” – have warned that the persistent gender gap in digital access holds women back.
It sounds slightly wonky, but it has serious implications.
A global analysis of 133 AI systems across industries found that 44.2 per cent demonstrate gender bias .
According to UN Women:
Women and girls remain underrepresented across the creation, use, and regulation of technology.
They are less likely to use digital services or enter tech-related careers, and significantly more likely to face online harassment and violence.
According to recent data , women’s exclusion from the digital world comes with massive costs for all, and has shaved USD 1 trillion from the gross domestic product of low- and middle-income countries in the last decade, it states.
So the UN is arguing that he voices of women, girls, and other marginalized groups are urgently needed in decision-making processes.
Tech that was genuinely gender-responsive could transform innovation, empower women on a global scale and tackle inequality in the digital age, it argues.
In his message to commemorate IWD UN Secretary-General António Guterres said:
Women today make up under a third of the workforce in science, technology, engineering, and maths. And when women are under-represented in developing new technologies, discrimination may be baked in from the start. Investing in women uplifts all people, communities, and countries.
UN Women Executive Director Soma Bahous said:
Women and girls have just as much right to access the digital world and prosper in it as men and boys. Their creativity, knowledge and perspectives can shape a future where technology contributes to transforming social norms, amplifying women’s voices, pushing forward against online harassment, preventing the perpetuation of algorithmic biases, and distributing the benefits of digitalization as the great equalizer to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
Our vision of equality, of what our world could be, for all of us, can and will include the equal enjoyment of the fruits of technology and innovation without fear of violence or abuse of any sort.
Women and girls must be able to engage, create, learn and work, safely and productively either online or offline, making the most of all the opportunities in every sphere of life and at every stage of it, in education, in the economy, in society and in politics.
UN Women and the Inter-Parliamentarian Union (IPU) have also produced the Women in Politics map ,.
The new data—as of 1 January 2023—shows that women’s voices and experiences are missing:
Less than 1 in 4 cabinet ministers is a woman, mainly leading on policy areas related to gender equality and women’s rights, while men still dominate economic, defence, energy, and other powerful portfolios
Women in top political leadership jobs worldwide represent only 11.3 per cent of countries’ Heads of State, and 9.8 per cent of countries’ Heads of Government.
Women now make up 26.5% of Members of Parliament around the world, up slightly from 25.5% in 2021.
Tonight I’ll be hosting an online Guardian Live event with Davina McCall, Miatta Fahnbulleh and Jo Cheetham – and it’s going to be great.
We are going to be talking about women’s power and how it can be harnessed for change – and these are women who know how to get stuff done.
Here’s a little bit about them
- Davina McCall, whose taboo-smashing documentaries have put conversations about menopause into the mainstream. She continues to combat misinformation and bring together a heartening sense of community and a positive collective spirit.
- Miatta Fahnbulleh , the CEO of the New Economics Foundation, a Labour candidate and part of the groundbreaking initiative, MotherRed , which strives to amplify more mothers’ voices in politics.
- Jo Cheetham , author of Killjoy which tells the story of how she went from not being particularly political or assertive, would never raise her hand in class and apologised to people who barged into her in the street, to joining the hugely successful No More Page 3 campaign.

Really interesting report by the the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), funded by the Nuffield Foundation, on the gender pension gap .
The findings are pretty stark
– 59% of women were saving into a pension in 2019, compared with 66% of men
– Average annual pension contributions made by women were £2,600, £800 less than the £3,400 put in by men
– Even for the youngest workers, women are putting less aside for their pension
– Women born in the early 1950s, who have reached pensionable age, have private pension incomes around 45% lower than men
All this has long term implications says author Heidi Karjalainen
In other words, women are putting less money into pensions because women’s earnings are on average lower. In order to reduce the gender pension income gap of the future, the gender pay gap would have to be reduced now. (6/9)
But when do pension contributions drop off a cliff? After women produce the tax payers of the future of course!
Reducing gender gaps in pension saving is really a question of how labour markets in general work for women. For example – six years after the birth of first child, fathers' average pension contributions are more than double those made by mothers. (7/9) https://t.co/QxnF6yfyaX
Police officers wielding batons charged at participants of a march in Islamabad on Wednesday, as thousands of women took to the streets of cities in Pakistan despite being told to stay at home.

Across the country, women held rallies – known as Aurat marches – demanding equal rights and the end of violence against women , while chanting slogans for the economic, political and social rights of women, and freedom for women from patriarchy.
In Islamabad, Pakistan’s capital, Afghan refugees and women from the Hazara community also took part in the march and demanded refugees’ and women’s rights for Afghans.
In Ghotki, thousands of women could be seen marching in protest.

After the incident in Islamabad, Pakistan’s interior minister said he had suspended the police officers involved.
The interior minister tweeted:
The police personnel involved in baton-charging the participants of the Women's March have been suspended. Moreover, other persons responsible for misbehavior are also being identified, and proper action will be taken against them too.
Amna Mawaz, a participant of the march in Islamabad, told the Guardian:
At first they, police, put containers in our way to block us from attending the march and then they resorted to violence.
Women are facing a plethora of problems and issues here and we have seen a rise in violence against women, and not far from here, a woman was gang-raped in a park in Lahore.
The society is decaying and we are confronting the state and feudal mentality for our rights. We would fight this mentality no matter what.

said women affected by them experienced crippling economic and emotional impacts:
When we, women, go out to protest against enforced disappearances, we are declared as anti-state. Be it Kashmir or Palestine, women are leading the fight against enforced disappearances .

The proportion of imprisoned female journalists has doubled in the past five years, according to RSF’s press freedom barometer .
Fourteen countries around the world are holding female journalists in prison: China (21), Iran (12), Belarus (10), Vietnam (4) and Turkey (4).
The RSF says female journalists have paid the price for being at the front line in recent crises.
Iran:
Of the 12 women journalists currently detained in Iran, 11 were arrested in the wake of the protests about Kurdish student Mahsa Amini’s death in police custody. Two of the women journalists who did most to draw the public’s attention to her case – Nilufar Hamedi , by going to the hospital where she was in a coma, and Elahe Mohammadi , by covering her funeral – are accused of “propaganda against the system” and “conspiring to act against national security – charges that could carry the death penalty.
Afghanistan:
The media landscape in Afghanistan has changed beyond recognition in less than two years. Half of the 526 media outlets that existed until the summer of 2021 have had to close and, of the 2,300 women journalists registered prior to 15 August 2021 (the date of the Taliban takeover), fewer than 200 are still working. Almost all of the women journalists (90%) have had to leave their jobs and some have fled the country, although exactly how many have managed to flee is not known.
Those still working must accept conditions that are becoming more and more draconian if not impossible. The Taliban recently banned women journalists from interviewing men and from attending press conferences in some provinces. Similarly, they are banned from hosting radio or TV shows together with male colleagues, or from receiving male guests.
The Taliban Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Repression of Vice has also imposed a strict dress code. When women journalists are on camera, they must be covered from head to toe and only their eyes may be seen.
Despite the terrible weather, people have gathered in Parliament Square for a protest organised by Waspi (Women Against State Pension Inequality).
The Waspi campaign argues that thousands of older women are struggling with the cost of living because of a pensions “injustice” dating back years that has never been put right.
As my colleague Rupert Jones explained in this piece :
Waspi was founded seven years ago to fight for compensation for women who lost out because of the way changes to the state pension age (SPA) were made .
For decades the SPA for women was 60. An increase to 65, phased in between 2010 and 2020, was included in the Pensions Act 1995, but in 2011 the coalition government pushed through a speeding-up of the process. As a result, the SPA for women increased to 65 by November 2018, and then to 66 by October 2020.
Many say they had always expected to receive their pension at 60, then discovered their SPA had increased by four, five or six years. The government did not write to any woman affected by the rise for nearly 14 years after the law was passed in 1995.

Here are some pictures of how International Women’s Day is being celebrated across the world.
IranWire reports that in London, protesters will walk from the Palace of Westminster to the Iranian embassy in the Kensington area of London, dressed as handmaids in support of the rights of women in Iran.
Each person will hold a poster of a female protester who has been killed, maimed or imprisoned by the regime since the start of “Mahsa protests” in Iran in September 2022.
The protest movement was sparked by the death of a 22-year-old woman, Mahsa Amini, in the custody of morality police. Amini had been arrested for an alleged breach of the Islamic Republic’s strict dress code for women.
The protest has been organised by Stage of Freedom.

For years, women have marked the now-annual event on 8 March in different ways, but mostly to build momentum on issues that matter to them, and to inspire change.
The day’s origins date back to the beginning of the 20th century : in 1908, thousands of women marched through New York City, demanding better working hours and pay. A year later, the Socialist party of America declared a Women’s Day.
The idea of an international day came from Clara Zetkin, then leader of the “women’s office” for the Social Democratic party in Germany, while she was at a conference in Copenhagen in 1910. She proposed a celebration on the same day every year to press for demands.

Illegal migration bill will hurt women trafficked to UK, Starmer tells PM
Rishi Sunak’s plan to stop small boat crossings will “drive a coach and horses” through protections for women who are trafficked to Britain as victims of modern slavery, Keir Starmer has said.
The Labour leader made the warning to coincide with International Women’s Day, as he labelled new legislation to tackle illegal migration a “gimmick” and warned it was likely to lead to yet another broken promise.
Highlighting the five announcements previously hailed by prime ministers as a means to reduce the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats, Starmer challenged Sunak to confirm how many people would be returned under the latest policy and when removals would start.
Though Sunak avoided answering the questions directly, he was ebullient about the progress being made to tackle the number of arrivals in small boats, which rose to 45,000 last year. He called Starmer “just another lefty lawyer standing in our way” to cheers from the Conservative benches, in a fiery exchange between the two leaders at prime minister’s questions.
Ahead of a trip to France later this week to improve cooperation on dealing with the issue, Sunak was repeatedly challenged about the feasibility of his plan announced on Tuesday under which all those who arrive in small boats will be detained and deported.
Though the Rwanda returns scheme is held up in the courts and ministers have admitted the new illegal migration bill might break the UK’s obligations under the European convention on human rights, Sunak insisted he would press ahead with a plan to deliver on what he called “the people’s priority”.
He stressed the UK would remain a “compassionate and generous country”, but said only those who arrive “fairly and legally” would have their asylum claims considered.
Sunak has set no date for his target to “stop the boats” and Starmer challenged him to say when the crossings would end. The prime minister said he would implement the plan “as soon as we pass it through parliament” – expected to be later this year, given an anticipated showdown in the House of Lords, which is likely to be followed by legal challenges.
Though Sunak drew attention to Starmer’s previous support for free movement, the Labour leader said that as director of public prosecutions he had overseen the deportation of rapists and added the conviction rate for people-smuggling was twice then what it was today.
Starmer also pointed to government statistics which showed that the number of people arriving on small boats whose asylum claims had been processed had fallen from 4% a few months ago to 1%.
In an attempt to show there was some progress on an issue that has captivated many “red wall” Tory MPs, Sunak argued there were now 6,000 fewer people in the asylum backlog and pointed to more caseworkers being hired.
He also laid into Starmer for criticising the Rwanda removal scheme, and claimed Labour supported “open-door immigration and unlimited asylum” putting it “on the side of the people smugglers”.
Starmer said: “If he was serious about stopping the boats, he’d actually steal our plan on stopping the boats, smash the gangs, sort out the returns and clear up this utter mess.”

Happy International Women’s Day: a look back at over a century of the global fight for justice and equality
I n India, a mural painted by women is being revealed at a metro station . In Mexico, protesters will be on the streets, demanding women’s rights. Jamaica will see the first all-female sitting of parliament . And in China, men will present the women in their lives with gifts. Happy International Women’s Day.
For years, women have marked the now-annual event on 8 March in different ways, but mostly to build momentum on issues that matter to them, and to inspire change.
The day’s origins date back to the beginning of the 20th century : in 1908, thousands of women marched through New York City, demanding better working hours and pay. A year later, the Socialist Party of America declared a Women’s Day.
The idea of an international day came from Clara Zetkin, leader of the “women’s office” for the Social Democratic Party in Germany, while she was at a conference in Copenhagen in 1910. She proposed a celebration on the same day every year to press for demands.
London saw a march in support of women’s suffrage on 8 March 1914, and thousands of women in Russia protested to demand bread and peace on 8 March 1917 (23 February in the Julian calendar in use in Russia at the time), heralding the start of the Russian revolution. Four days later, the tsar was forced to abdicate, and the provisional government granted women the right to vote.
“International Women’s Day comes out of revolutionary movements among working-class women as well as [their] supporters,” says Temma Kaplan, an activist and retired professor of history at Rutgers University in the US. “It had an intellectual and public face because mobilisation was part of early socialist women’s and suffragist movements.”
The UN adopted the day in 1975, which it had declared international women’s year, and uses it to promote a particular issue, campaign or theme. IWD is now a public holiday in countries including Nepal, Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone, Cambodia and Kyrgyzstan. In China, women get a half-day holiday.
The annual day has drawn criticism from feminists who say it risks becoming little more than a corporate Valentine’s Day, with companies using the occasion to “pinkwash” their brands rather than promote women’s equality.
In South Africa, which has its own National Women’s Day in August, alcohol companies use feminist messaging in their advertising campaigns to coincide with the date, says Laurine Platzky, an academic activist in Cape Town. “The alcohol industry has identified Africa as a new growth market. The adverts use the feminist narrative. It’s been so abused. It really freaks me out.”
But IWD has retained its radical roots, providing a rallying point to fight attempts to roll back women’s rights and inaction over gender-based violence. Some recent demonstrations have been large and violent. On 8 March 2021 in Mexico, where at least 10 women are murdered each day , police used rubber bullets and teargas during clashes that erupted between protesters and the police .
Macarena Sáez, the executive director of the women’s rights division of Human Rights Watch, says protests across Latin America have brought issues to the fore and put pressure on authorities to change laws. “Argentina, Colombia and Mexico are great examples of [countries where there has been progress] achieved by women,” she says. “ Gains in reproductive rights in Argentina have been considerable. It’s the same in Colombia. It’s because of the fight and positions women have taken that [led to] one of the most progressive decisions on reproductive rights .”
In Spain, record crowds came out on 8 March 2019 and 2020 to protest against violence against women. In April 2018, five men had been acquitted of rape in what became known as the “wolf pack” case . The outcome galvanised the country’s feminist movement and spurred calls for an overhaul of the country’s sexual offences legislation .
In South Korea, on IWD in 2018, hundreds rallied in central Seoul holding #MeToo signs as part of the movement that saw several high-profile South Korean men resign from positions of power.
That this is able to happen at all is a sign of progress, according to Sáez. “The issue of women’s rights is now mainstream, where for many years it was marginalised,” she says. “A day to commemorate the gains of women’s rights is in itself the triggering of change. As with any movement, mobilisations do matter. Of course, it’s never enough, but at the same time it’s a space that is recognised.”
Kaplan adds that the media’s coverage of IWD helps. “International Women’s Day became one of the leading ways movements could get attention from the press and larger society and make arguments in a public forum.”
However, all that is under threat, says Reem Alsalem, the UN special rapporteur on violence against women and girls. “We are seeing an increased crackdown on women’s attempts to organise rallies and mark International Women’s Day,” she says. “It goes to show how politicised the women’s rights agenda has become, and also the backlash against gender equality we are witnessing in many parts of the world.”
Some situations facing women don’t make the headlines, she says. And even if they do – as in Afghanistan and Iran – Alsalem questions how much action is taken by governments and the international community. “There is now a tendency to identify the one group we believe is at risk, hone in on that and deprioritise the rest.
“The other women go into oblivion and become invisible. Some are eventually able to mobilise and get attention, including media attention, to tell their stories. Let’s face it, however, a vast majority will not.”
Despite this, IWD is an annual reminder of the fight that women face as well as the achievements they have made, says Julie Gottlieb, a professor of modern history at the University of Sheffield. “What we’ve found about International Women’s Day is its fluidity and the way it adapts to present day concerns.
“It’s very adaptive. We’re not celebrating the same thing every year – we’re dealing with the existing challenges that women face.”

Wednesday briefing: Five key issues facing women – from misogyny to the ‘motherhood penalty’
Good morning.
International Women’s Day is upon us. For the last century, 8 March has been a day to celebrate women’s achievements, to rally around the progress that has been made to achieve gender equality and to bring attention to the mountain of work that still needs to be done to protect women and girls.
While it is hard to ignore the fervent commercialisation of the day, with corporations aggressively pushing contrived gimmicks to get some of that sweet, sweet PR, its roots in socialism and the suffrage movements of the early 20th century expose its more radical origins. And it is with this in mind that many come together, every March, to agitate for gender parity. The past few years have felt particularly fraught for women’s rights – violence against women and girls around the world has increased, the pandemic has intensified gender inequality and decades of progress are threatened as new forms of misogyny find their way into classrooms and online forums.
Today’s newsletter runs you through a selection of the Guardian’s coverage around women’s issues. That’s right after the headlines.
Immigration and asylum | Rishi Sunak’s government has been accused of “extinguishing the right to seek refugee protection in the UK” by the United Nations refugee agency. In an unusually critical statement, the UNHCR said a contentious new law to stop small boats crossing the Channel “would amount to an asylum ban”. Here’s an explainer on the bill’s contents.
UK news | Olivia Pratt-Korbel, the nine-year-old girl who was shot dead in her home in Liverpool last August, screamed “Mum, I’m scared” before she was hit by a bullet, a court has heard . Thomas Cashman, 34, killed Olivia in a shooting that went “horribly wrong”, a prosecutor told Manchester crown court.
France | More than 1.2m protesters marched in France on Tuesday as rail workers and refinery staff began rolling strikes and trade unions stepped up their campaign to try to stop Emmanuel Macron’s plan to raise the pension age to 64. The action was the sixth such nationwide strike of the year.
Abortion | Nurses and midwives should be able to approve abortions , MPs have been told, in what would be one of the biggest shake-ups of regulations in more than 55 years. A government-commissioned study calls for the end of a rule saying that abortions have to be authorised by two doctors.
Health | In a groundbreaking clinical trial involving 100 women, researchers will assess a potential new treatment for endometriosis . If successful it will be the first non-hormonal, non-surgical treatment for a condition that affects roughly one in 10 women of reproductive age.
Violence against women: systemic failings
Earlier this week, former police officer Wayne Couzens was sentenced to 19 months for three offences of indecent exposure that occurred in the months before he raped and murdered Sarah Everard in 2021. The extra months on his sentence do not change the reality that Couzens will spend the rest of his life behind bars, but the trial has exposed police failures that allowed Couzens to continue acting as a serving police officer with a firearm.
The Metropolitan police has apologised for failing to arrest Couzens for his offences, including one that happened a few days before he killed Sarah Everard. But this apology has felt insufficient to many: one of his victims suggested that Everard’s life “could have been saved” had the police acted on the reports. The incident reveals a systemic inability to deal with flashing – in 2021 the Guardian reported that police in England and Wales logged more than 10,000 cases of indecent exposure in the previous year but took fewer than 600 people to court over them.
Dr Jennifer Grant said: “The system reflects our society, which has tended to see indecent exposure as a nuisance offence,” as opposed to a sexual crime. “We know that some men who indecently expose themselves go on to commit further sexual and violent crimes,” Grant adds, pointing to a study from the US that found that 5- 10% of men do escalate to more serious offences .
Flashing is one facet of a growing problem: John Harris spoke to Laura Bates about online misogyny and revenge porn, and how the so-called “manosphere” has been radicalising boys and young men.
The workplace: women pay the ‘motherhood penalty’
Women continue to face serious impediments to equality in the workplace, several stories published today suggest. Under current trends, the gender pay gap between men and women will not close until 2044 in the UK, with older women worst affected. Labour will announce today that former Trades Union Congress chief Frances O’Grady will lead a review of how best to accelerate that progress, Pippa Crerar reports.
One crucial contributor to the problem is the so-called “motherhood penalty”: data published by consultancy group PwC finds that the gender pay gap widened four times faster in the UK in 2021 than the average across the OECD, primarily because of the specific disadvantages faced by women with children. Alexandra Topping covers a study by academics at the University of Kent which finds that the impact of having children is greater now for university-educated women than it was 40 years ago.
That PwC data also shows that childcare costs represent almost one-third of the average family income in the UK, compared with as little as 1% in Germany. For a sense of the impact of that situation, see this piece by Lucy Pasha-Robinson , which is stuffed with alarming figures and reflects her own experience of her daughter’s recent bout of flu: “Patchy earnings, alongside the nursery fees we paid despite her being unable to attend, left us at least £700 in the red – for the second time in three months.”
Mental health: the inevitable toll of the patriarchy
Some figures suggest that women are more likely to have mental health problems than men: one study by a clinical psychologist at Oxford University found that women are up to 40% more likely than men to develop mental health conditions . But these numbers that seem to show a growing gender disparity in mental health obscure a bigger context, writes Sanah Ahsan today .
“We are not living through a crisis of chemical imbalances, but of power imbalances,” she says, pointing to a world where women are more likely to experience poverty, as well as sexual and domestic violence. Some of these women are then put through a mental health system that often ignores the patriarchal causes of their suffering and itself has a long history of misogyny. Psychiatric diagnosis can be extremely helpful – but Ahsan invites us to think bigger and begin to “dismantle the systems of oppression that are hurting us”.
A global strategy
The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) has launched a global initiative to advance gender equality, support sexual and reproductive health programmes and fund grassroots women’s rights groups, writes Kaamil Ahmed . Advancing gender equality is a noble goal, and on International Women’s Day no less, however critics have called the proposed strategy “meaningless” and said that it simply is not enough. The news also comes on the same day as the start of a parliamentary inquiry that will investigate the impact of the government’s aid funding cuts on women and girls in low-income countries.
International Women’s Day: “Dumbed down into a marketing opportunity”
While IWD remains a crucial means of gathering attention and information around women’s causes, there are real concerns that it has been “captured by commerce”, writes Nilanjana Bhowmick in New Delhi.
In this piece , she notes one example of an endless stream of businesses jostling for attention in her inbox: “No amount of discounts or offers are enough to appreciate women. However, here’s our little effort in making them feel ultra-special … up to 50% off all our products until Women’s Day.” Bhowmick adds: “We don’t need vouchers or discounts. We need equal rights at home and at work. We need to be heard.”
Yuval Noah Harari’s speech at a pro-democracy demonstration in Israel on Saturday, repurposed as a comment piece here , sets out the stakes of opposition to Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right government in the starkest possible terms. “We must raise our voices now – or keep our mouths shut for the rest of our lives,” he writes. “When a tiger comes to devour us, we cannot negotiate a compromise.” Archie

As a Peckham local, Steve Rose writes , a new romcom set in his neighbourhood – Rye Lane – isn’t all it’s cracked up to be: “A love letter can also be a marketing brochure.” It’s part of a surprisingly long, and totally fascinating, history of “gentrification by genre”. Archie

Pregnant Russians are coming to Argentina in droves in search of a “golden ticket” of a passport that allows visa-free access to more than 170-countries. This Washington Post story is a fascinating explanation of how that’s playing out in Buenos Aires. Archie
Football | Kai Havertz’s retaken penalty ensured Chelsea made it through to the quarter-final of the Champions League after beating Borussia Dortmund 2-0. Chelsea’s win potentially marks the beginning of Graham Potters comeback, writes Jacob Steinberg, as just a week ago “he was two defeats away from the sack”.
Crowd safety | Uefa has confirmed that Liverpool fans (pictured above) who bought tickets for last May’s Champions League final are eligible for a refund after the chaos that marred the match in Paris. The European governing body acted in response to a report finding it bears “primary responsibility” for catastrophic organisational and safety failures.
Rugby | In the Breakdown newsletter , Robert Kitson writes about the debate in England’s camp over who should play fly-half: Owen Farrell, Marcus Smith, or George Ford. His piece is a really interesting dissection of a rugby debate that “has been the same for as long as the game has been played”. Do you prefer a “fancy dan” or “defensive solidity”? “After a while it becomes less a sporting debate than a soul-baring symbol of your entire personality.” Sign up to get the Breakdown every week here .
“Tories ‘extinguishing right to seek refugee protection in UK’, says UN” – welcome to our paper summary, beginning with the front page of today’s Guardian print edition. “Sunak ready to battle judges over migration” – papers tend to use “migration” in headlines, as the Times has done here, to mean “immigration” when the latter won’t fit. The Daily Telegraph goes after the BBC, which it says is “urged to sack Lineker after ‘Nazi’ migrant jibe” – a word Gary Lineker does not appear to have actually used in saying the Tories’ crackdown was couched in language “not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s”. The Daily Mail’s take is more accurate: “Lineker faces BBC rebuke for likening small boats plan to Nazis”. The Daily Express has “Rishi lays down law: we decide who comes here”. “Carry on sewage pumping: water firms are told to self-police their pollution” says the i . “Mum, I’m scared” – little Olivia Pratt Korbel’s plea before she was shot and killed leads the Daily Mirror . The Metro uses the same. The splash in the Financial Times is “Powell signals return of larger Fed rate rises amid battle to cool inflation”.

A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad
For New York-based writer Rae Meadows, taking up gymnastics in her 40s was physically tough and humbling. However, she soon found her way back to the sport she had loved as a child, and now practices three times a week. Writing for the Guardian’s “what makes me happy now” series, she describes how pushing herself in the gym has helped her to surpass her perceived limits. “My body hurts all the time: sore muscles, stiff joints, nagging echoes of old injuries. Sometimes to get out of bed I have to roll on my side and push myself up,” she writes. “But it’s a small price to pay for such wondrous returns. At a time in life when many things feel like they are sliding down the slope towards old, gymnastics is a gift of fluency and competence in motion … I’m a better gymnast now than I was at 16.”

Wild women: the rise of all-female outdoor activity groups
I t was a little after midnight when I heard footsteps approaching my bivvy bag. Normally when wild camping, a sound like this would cause me to sink further into my sleeping bag, hoping I wouldn’t be seen. Yet that night, sleeping on a hillside on the western escarpment of the Chilterns in Buckinghamshire, there was no need – or indeed chance – to remain hidden. I was surrounded by six other women in bivvies, giving a whole new meaning to the phrase “girl’s night out”.
As an adventurer and ardent solo wild camper, I have for more than 15 years been voluntarily plunging myself into the wilderness – in the UK and overseas – alone. I have never needed company on adventures. I’m not afraid of the dark, or worried about going for a pee in the middle of the night. Sleeping out solo doesn’t scare me. But wild camping in a group – especially a group of other women – terrified me.
Of the six with me that night, four had never wild camped before, while the other two were fellow adventurers Sophie Roberts and Anna McNuff. The latter would, a couple of months after our camp, officially co-found an online adventure community for women called Adventure Queens .
I arrived late by train from London and tracked them down from a Google Maps pin they’d sent me from the hillside. Already the conversation was in full swing and I felt apprehensive about joining them. While the novice campers were talking about their fears of sleeping outside, I, conversely, worried about the socialising. I’ve always had more male friends than female, and in school I never really fitted in – didn’t wear makeup, didn’t enjoy shopping, and was always accused of not being “girly” enough.
Yet as soon as I arrived I was welcomed into the fold. I was handed a plate of food, offered a drink and included in the conversation. There was no campfire – that would have been against the wild campers’ etiquette – but I felt unexpectedly warmed by their presence.
“Adventure Queens began as a single Facebook group,” says Nadia Weigh, the current community co-lead. “We wanted to create a space for women to share ideas and exchange tips, but it has grown.”
Now there are 13,000 community members, 60 volunteers, 25 regional groups, three international ones and a mums’ group too. Not bad for something that began as a night out on a hillside for a small group of friends.
They are not the only women’s group to have seen phenomenal growth. “I didn’t come from an outdoorsy background,” says Bex Band, founder of Love Her Wild , another UK-based non-profit adventure community. “But after hiking in Israel I wanted to do more in Britain. I started a Facebook group, hoping to connect and learn skills with other like-minded women, and it just snowballed – growing massively since the pandemic. Now we have more than 50,000 Wilders spread over 40 regional groups in Britain.”
After conducting a survey of members, Band found the main barriers to women getting into the outdoors are lack of confidence and concerns over safety. The women I camped out with in the Chilterns echoed these worries. Several said they would only be able to sleep knowing there was a group of us. One asked if someone would come with her if she woke up needing to pee in the night. Immediately her bivvy neighbour offered. It was a small gesture, but clearly meant a lot.
Reading through the comments and posts on Love Her Wild and Adventure Queens now, I can see that their strength lies in the online chat. No one feels too shy to ask how to put up a tent or deal with a period on an adventure; it’s like tapping into a massive book of cheerleading contacts, instantly.
Other women’s adventure communities include the Muslim Women’s Travel Group , started in 2015 by Sadia Ramzan. “Muslim women have more specific questions, such as food being halal, tolerance to wearing a hijab and being away from places that serve alcohol,” she says. “It was a great way of making friends and asking questions.” Now her Facebook group has more than 27,000 followers and she runs overseas trips – two this year are already sold out.
Gutsy Girls was established five years ago by Natalie Bannister, who moved to London, felt isolated and decided to form a group on Meetup. It started with six women meeting to try standup paddleboarding in the capital, and has grown to the point where Natalie runs it full-time. In 2022 she took 1,000 women on 400 trips in Europe, and 266 in the UK.
In the Chilterns, when I woke up the next morning, just as dawn was starting to illuminate the inner green walls of my bivvy bag, Anna had already fired up the camping stove and offered me a coffee. As I sipped my brew I again felt warmed, by the gesture and the drink.
Many of these groups, which also include Black Girls Hike (which started in 2019 as a walking group and has grown to become a certified training provider, offering trips overseas), have seen their membership grow by thousands, but others are choosing to remain small and simple.
Sarah Gerrish started Wonderful Wild Women in 2016 when she moved back to Cumbria with her young family and didn’t have anyone to enjoy the outdoors with. She started on Instagram, inviting others to meet for coffee and, if they liked, a wild swim. This became a monthly event, along with trail runs, book club meets and skill sessions. Despite pressure to grow, especially recently, she has steadfastly decided to keep it local and free. “I just want to shine a light on normal, everyday women who have families, jobs and responsibilities,” she says.
That morning on the hillside, with my first group of female campmates, we spent at least an hour talking, our conversation moving seamlessly from how to fix a leaky bivvy bag to identifying the red kites flying overhead, and complaining about the lack of trains to where we wanted to go on a Saturday. People asked me what I was doing next, and seemed to be genuinely rooting for me when I told them my goals. I had arrived a sceptic but left feeling supported.
By the time we said our goodbyes, everyone was beaming – the newbies from surviving their first bivvy, the adventurers from sharing their skills, and me from finally finding a girls’ night out that could be friendly, not frightening.

We don’t need discount vouchers for International Women’s Day. We need equal rights
B rands wanting to “appreciate” women are offering discounts on clothes and makeup, and celebrities are urging women to use the day to pamper themselves. In India , International Women’s Day has been captured by commerce.
“No amount of discounts or offers are enough to appreciate women. However, here’s our little effort in making them feel ultra-special … up to 50% off all our products until Women’s Day,” read yet another of many such messages in my inbox last week.
There are some programmes by government and NGOs, but they remain constrained within air-conditioned conference halls. The common woman – the one who jostles for her place at the tube station or bus stop, or remains cloistered within the home – has no access to these empowered gatherings. What is available to her are discount vouchers and social media shorts, stripping the day of all its celebration and purpose.
And what is Women’s Day when stripped of its political purpose? The stereotypical “ladies who lunch” having extra spas and shopping sprees on their spouses’ credit cards. Or token celebrations with a few women who have been empowered.
Where are the all-India rallies where we could mobilise women to be inspired, interact with one other and demand, with one voice, our rights?
More and more women in India are stepping out to work to boost the family income while fighting a capitalist-patriarchal system that want them to prioritise their roles as homemakers and stay in low-paid, low-growth jobs. In the workplace, they face an expectation to “work like a man”, otherwise they are weak and unproductive. And then, when they come home, they must once again resume the domestic goddess role, cooking like Nigella Lawson, caring like Florence Nightingale.
Is it any wonder that Indian women end up doing almost 10 times more unpaid caregiving than Indian men? If International Women’s Day (IWD) is for taking stock of gender inequalities, let’s do that. If the government was interested in bringing change, it would announce women-friendly work policies. If businesses were serious, they would take a good look at how gender-responsive their organisations are, and make changes.
In Indian society, businesses have managed to dumb down an important day for putting out calls of action to demand political, economic and social equality for women.
IWD is seen as a marketing opportunity, with superficial, slogan-centric, hashtag-dependent campaigns targeted at profits rather than beginning a conversation about vicious inequalities that still persist in this country. The brands are commodifying feminism, but if only they showed true commitment to the day and pushed for gender equalities, they would actually benefit.
It’s a no-brainer really: raising awareness about women’s education and employment and helping women access equal work opportunities would raise their status in society, giving them more decision-making and purchasing power.
Capitalism thinks patriarchy is its mate, but it would gain far more by aligning itself with women’s financial and intellectual empowerment. According to Nielsen , by 2028, women will own 75% of the discretionary spend, making them the world’s influencers. Companies, the report said, need to “rethink their approach to marketing, innovation and designing services for women. The data shows that just paying lip service is … encouraging disloyalty and causing fatigue.”
If you want to argue that the increased visibility of IWD through commercialisation can raise awareness and spark conversations about gender inequality, unfortunately that is not the case in India, where commercialisation means shoving the real issues under the carpet. Governments around the world should make it mandatory for businesses who want to use IWD to market their products to follow certain parameters that would also raise awareness about women’s rights.
This is urgent in India, where gender equality has made some progress but still has miles to go. As of 2020, the gender pay gap in India was estimated to be around 19%. In education, according to the World Economic Forum’s 2021 Global Gender Gap report , the literacy rate for adult females in India is 70.3%, compared to 84.7% for adult males.
Women make up just 23% of the total labour force in India . As of 2021, women hold only 22.5% of the seats in the lower house of India’s parliament, and 10.9% of the seats in the upper house.
Violence against women remains endemic in India. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, there were more than 400,000 cases of crimes against women reported in India in 2019, including rape, kidnapping and domestic violence.
Women’s Day is not just a slogan – it is a day when we must talk about these issues. It is time to remember the women who fought on our behalf for those rights we enjoy today. For them, for us and for our daughters, we need to take back Women’s Day from the clutches of advertising and marketing brains.
We don’t need vouchers or discounts. We need equal rights at home and at work. We need to be heard. We need to be included in decision-making and policy formulation. But all of it must start from our homes.
Gender equality is not rocket science. Neither is it a spa voucher. It starts as a conversation at home and grows into a movement.

Two-thirds of UK women say childcare duties affected career progression
Two-thirds of women with childcare responsibilities believe they have missed out on career progression as a direct result, business leaders have warned, amid growing pressure on the government to boost support for parents.
Ahead of next week’s budget, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said tackling barriers to work posed by soaring childcare costs and a lack of support for elderly or disabled relatives was vital for equality and the economy.
In a landmark survey of more than 4,000 women, it found as many as 67% felt childcare duties in the past decade had cost them progress at work – including pay rises, promotions, or career development. Almost 90% believed that additional support was needed.
In the study, released to coincide with International Women’s Day, BCC, which represents thousands of companies across the UK, also found that three-quarters of women said there was not sufficient support for those going through menopause.
Shevaun Haviland, the BCC’s director general, said urgent action was required from the government and employers to break down barriers and ensure women had the same opportunities as men.
“Tackling these issues is integral not only to the wellbeing of our women and workplaces, it is crucial to the functioning of any strong economy,” she said.
The intervention adds to pressure on the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt , to use his upcoming budget to provide more support for parents to work, amid warnings from economists that sky-high childcare costs are among the reasons why thousands of people have quit the jobs market.
Hunt is widely expected to place growing workforce participation at the heart of his statement, but is thought to be unlikely to announce major new funding for childcare amid government concerns over the public finances.
However, charities, trade unions, and business groups argue that supporting more people to work could benefit the economy in the longer term.
New analysis by the Centre for Local Economic Strategies and the Women’s Budget Group, published on Wednesday, finds the barriers to paid work faced by women mean almost £90bn of gross value added is lost to the economy in England, Scotland and Wales each year – equivalent to the entire contribution of the financial services industry.
Meanwhile, the Trades Union Congress has calculated that almost 1.5 million women are kept out of the labour market because of their caring responsibilities, compared with 230,000 men, making them seven times as likely to stand outside the workforce.
In analysis published as the annual TUC women’s conference starts in London on Wednesday, the unions’ umbrella group said this showed ministers had to act now to keep women in work, make sure they are paid fairly, and to properly address the gender pay gap.
Paul Nowak, the TUC general secretary, said: “We desperately need funded high-quality childcare for all families, free at the point of use, so women can stay in work once they have kids.
“Ministers must change the law so that every single job is advertised with the possible flexible options stated, and all workers must have the legal right to work flexibly from their first day in a job.”
Separate analysis by the jobs website Adzuna shows that less than 3% out of job adverts online mention support for women. It called on employers to rethink the benefits they offer to help women stay in work and thrive, while highlighting that more job adverts mention free gym membership or unlimited holidays than menopause support.
Highlighting gender gaps despite progress made in recent years, the Institute for Fiscal Studies warned in its own report that inequalities between men and women for income from private pensions were set to persist for decades.
It said the difference between men’s and women’s average state pension incomes, for those born in the 1950s, had closed to essentially zero over the past decade. However, women still had private pension incomes about 45% lower than men.
The IFS said this was almost entirely driven by differences in labour market patterns – employment rates, hours worked and hourly wages – which particularly open up after the birth of children.
Laurence O’Brien, research economist at IFS, said the divisions persisted even for younger age groups: “As these generations will not retire for many decades, we can expect a gender gap in pension incomes to remain for a long time yet.”

‘Worse than childbirth’: women with endometriosis call for better treatments
L isa Hague, 38, was diagnosed with endometriosis at the age of 17 after being in such severe pain that she resorted to taking a powerful painkiller, dihydrocodeine, that had been prescribed to her partner for a sports injury. She had an allergic reaction to the codeine and was taken to hospital.
After speaking to a doctor about why she had taken such a risk, she was referred for a laparoscopy and diagnosed. “I’d never heard of endometriosis before and didn’t know anyone that had it,” she says. “It was just, some people are unlucky and get period pains and others don’t.”
The diagnosis was a relief, but there were few treatment options available and she has had to manage intense pain and very heavy bleeding for a few days each month. “I’ve had all four of my children with gas and air and my period pains are the worst pain I’ve ever experienced,” she says. “I’d describe it as contraction pain – an internal, muscular cramping pain – but at least in childbirth you get the break inbetween contractions.”
Hague, who lives in Nottingham and works as a grief counsellor, says that being self-employed means she can plan client activities, such as hosting grief retreats, so they don’t coincide with her period. “I’m so lucky that I work for myself – without that, I’d need a very understanding boss.”
At times, she has resorted to sitting against hot radiators or taking scalding baths to “as a distraction from the internal pain”. “It is very dismissed still at the doctors,” she says.
She has considered having a partial hysterectomy, but was advised that although this would stop her periods, it would not be guaranteed to reduce her pain. “Having surgery is a massive step, so I thought: better the devil I know,” she says. It is only recently, after visiting a gynaecologist, that she has found a combination of pain medication and drugs to reduce cramping, that her pain is mostly under control.
Hague says there is a “desperate need” for better treatments so that her teenage daughter’s generation do not face the same struggle. “Things have got to have changed since I was 17,” she says.

UK launches gender equality plan but critics call funding a ‘drop in the ocean’
The UK government has launched a new strategy to advance gender equality around the world on the same day that MPs announced plans to investigate the impact of UK aid cuts on women and girls.
The global strategy, launched by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) on International Women’s Day on Wednesday, will, it says, put more focus on gender equality in its work, while also supporting sexual and reproductive health programmes and funding grassroots women’s rights groups.
“Advancing gender equality and challenging discrimination is obviously the right thing to do, but it also brings freedom, boosts prosperity and trade, and strengthens security – it is the fundamental building block of all healthy democracies,” said foreign secretary James Cleverly while visiting schools and hospitals in Bo, his mother’s home town in Sierra Leone.
“Hard-won gains” in advancing gender equality – by getting more girls into school, reducing child marriage and increasing representation of women at the highest levels of politics – have come under threat, he said, from the climate crisis, conflict and policies by some governments in the world.
But the strategy announcement, the first since the FCDO was created in 2020, came as the International Development Committee (IDC) launched a parliamentary inquiry into the impact of the government’s own funding cuts on women and girls in low-income countries.
In 2021, the FCDO confirmed that £4bn would be cut from the aid budget . Last year, the government was accused of “betraying” women and girls after it emerged ministers had been warned that aid reductions would have an adverse affect on them.
The IDC said it had received evidence that cuts significantly affected the FCDO’s work with women and girls.
“The impact of cutting access to sexual and reproductive health services for women and their families in lower-income countries is huge,” said Sarah Champion, the committee’s chair.
“We know that this work can make the ultimate difference. We want to examine how the FCDO is meeting its pledges and will evaluate the impact of cuts to the UK’s aid budget in this vital area.”
Last week, the IDC criticised the government for diverting £1bn in foreign aid to house refugees in the UK in 2021.
Stephanie Siddall, the director of global policy and advocacy at Women for Women International, said the UK aid cuts have had a disproportionate impact on women. “In conflict and crisis we see increased poverty affecting women and girls, we see girls being unable to access schooling, and we see the drivers and consequences of gender-based violence increasing,” she said.
She said that any new strategy needed funding that would repair the impact of the funding cuts. As part of the strategy, the government said that £200m will be provided for women’s sexual health programmes, while £38m has been assigned to support women’s rights organisations and grassroots movements, which will mostly be distributed through the Equality Fund, which helps fund feminist movements.
Siddall said the amount was a “drop in the ocean” without a return to the UK spending 0.7% of national income on aid. “It’s all very well having a strategy but the government needs to put its money where its mouth is. It’s almost meaningless unless you’re going to have an appropriate budget,” she said.
Manali Desai, the head of Cambridge University’s sociology department and an expert on gendered violence in India and South Asia, said: “The FCDO needs to join up its strategy on women and girls to almost every facet of the current challenges facing areas receiving aid. These include poverty, climate change, war, migration and education, among others. Women and girls are affected in very specific ways by these events.”
But Bethan Cobley, the director of advocacy and partnerships at MSI Reproductive Choices, said the new strategy was “an important first step”. “Now adequate and sustained resourcing and implementation is vital through FCDO’s programme work and global influence,” she said.

ABC host Lisa Millar reveals anger but also hope after news sites republish ‘foul’ online abuse
The ABC News Breakfast host Lisa Millar says the amplification of misogynist online abuse has made her angry on behalf of Australian women – but the supportive response gave her hope progress is being made for women in the public arena.
The minister for women, Katy Gallagher, told Wednesday morning’s program on International Women’s Day that gender equality cannot be achieved while experiences like Millar’s affect the choices they make to enter jobs in public life.
Gallagher called out news organisations who republished online harassment for prioritising “clickbait” over community responsibility to tackle the problem.
“Amplifying it, repeating it, providing clickbait to generate readers, or customers to your site, I think is completely unacceptable because it makes the problem worse,” Gallagher said.
The ABC yesterday accused News Corp and the Daily Mail of amplifying misogynist social media abuse by publishing articles that included “vile” Twitter criticism of an outfit worn by Millar.
After Gallagher’s interview following the release of the government’s first Status of Women report card on International Women’s Day, Millar said: “I’d actually like to take a minute to talk about what went on during the last 48 hours.”
“The fact that what I wore on Monday attracted obnoxious commentary on Twitter, foul, disgusting, personal abuse that I wouldn’t and couldn’t repeat here, it was upsetting.
“That it then ended up online on some new sites where the photos and the abuse were republished made me angry.
“On this International Women’s Day, angry on behalf of myself, and also on behalf of other women, young women who see those stories and see someone like me being violently abused day after day for whatever reason bullies can find.
“I worry it might make you think that no progress has been made and that it’s not worth it to be a woman in the public arena.
“On this International Women’s Day I want to tell you the response over that rubbish yesterday actually gives me a bit of hope. We are making progress, we are going to make more progress …
“Please make a conscious decision today to be part of the solution. Play a part in making our communities and better, kinder place for everyone.”
Her co-host, Michael Rowland, praised Millar, saying: “We’ve all seen behind the scenes here you’ve gone through a lot. You’ve gone through the absolute wringer in the last couple of days.
“For you to be sitting here this morning is a testament to your courage and strength.”
Rowland said Millar was “too nice” to name news.com.au or the Daily Mail as the outlets that amplified those comments. “The editors of both websites should hang their heads in shame,” he said.
Gallagher said she was concerned that incidents like Millar’s affected the decisions of Australian women.
“For women in public life unfortunately, at the moment, this is part of our experience … if we want to pursue careers that are in the public life, our choice is put up with it, or withdraw from it,” the minister said. “It’s not an acceptable situation at all.
“And we know that it impacts on women’s choices… we’re not going to have a gender-equal Australia if people are seeing Lisa’s experience and others’ experience.
“It will mean that women choose not to go and pursue careers where they have to make or endure that kind of online abuse.”

UK gender pay gap for higher-educated parents has grown since 1970s – study
The pay gap between mothers and fathers with post-school education has increased since the late 1970s in the UK, according to research.
As the world marks International Women’s Day on Wednesday, research from the University of Kent has found that the gap in pay between higher-educated mothers and fathers – the “motherhood penalty” – is greater now than 40 years ago.
Dr Amanda Gosling, a senior lecturer in economics at the University of Kent, argues that the closing of the pay gap between men and women since the 1970s has largely been driven by economic factors such as the minimum wage and falling wages for less educated men, rather than societal progress.
“Barriers to career progression for mothers with some post-school education have hardly shifted,” she said. “The gap in pay between mothers and fathers looks very similar now as it did in the late 1970s. The story for Gen-Xers is the same for boomers and the millennials.”
According to data from the Office for National Statistics , based on the Annual Survey for Hours and Earnings (ASHE), the gender pay gap for full-time employees was 8.3% in 2022, up from 7.7% in 2021. Among all employees, the gender pay gap is 14.9%.
But Gosling said the gap for mothers was considerably larger than the one represented by the official gender pay gap. By her calculations, the hourly wages of mothers is 72% of the hourly wage of fathers, which reflects the fact that working mums are stalled in their career path, and less likely to go into the highest-paid roles.
She said her work, which splices microdata from the Family Expenditure Survey (1978-1999) and the Family Resources Survey (2000-2021), gave a fuller explanation of the extent of the “motherhood penalty”.
The research suggests that for higher-educated women, the gender pay gap has actually worsened since the 70s. Its preliminary findings show that in 1978, mothers aged between 23 and 59 who left school after the age of 18 made about 72% of the wages of equivalent fathers. By 2019 this had fallen to 69%.
This was despite the fact that mothers were now more educated than fathers, added Gosling. In 1978, 10% of fathers and 9% of mothers had any post-school education; by 2019 this had risen to 45% and 48% respectably. “Arguably, then, the current overall gap between the wages of mothers and fathers is understated because is does not control for the fact that mothers are more skilled,” she said.
In contrast, the gap between mothers and fathers without any post-school education has reduced significantly. Using the same datasets, mothers made 57% of the fathers’ wage in 1978, which increased to 70% in 2019.
“The story for mothers without any post-school education from the 1970s until quite recently paints a picture of fast progress, with the percentage gap reducing by almost half. However, over the last eight years the process of catchup has stalled,” she said.
“One possible explanation could be the squeeze in public sector pay, which would affect women more as they are more likely to work in the public sector, and the impact of austerity on women,” she said.
Sarah Ronan, early education and childcare lead at the Women’s Budget Group, said the research was “an indictment of our economy and the structures that underpin it”, adding: “For decades women have been told to ‘lean in’ while we’re actively pushed out. Childcare costs, poor parental leave, and gendered stereotypes about care all conspire to keep women stuck either at home or in low-paid precarious work.”
She called for reform of parental leave, to enable fathers to care for their children as much as mothers, and investment in childcare reform.
Joeli Brearley, the founder of Pregnant Then Screwed, accused the government of failing to take action to improve the lot of working mothers. Recent research from the campaign group showed 54% of women were having to work fewer hours due to the cost of childcare, up from 43% in 2022.
“Three-quarters of mothers who use childcare say that it no longer makes financial sense for them to work,” she said. “It is of little surprise to us that women’s career progression has changed very little since the 1970s when we’ve seen such a lacklustre approach from the government towards women’s equality.”

Women earn $1m less than men over lifetime and retire with $136,000 less super, study finds
Women in Australia earn $1m less on average over their lifetimes than men and retire with $136,000 less in superannuation, according to research released on International Women’s Day.
The research by the Australia Institute’s Centre for Future Work, released on Wednesday, suggests that the biggest driver of the gap in retirement savings is still the gender pay gap.
It found that women earning the median wage would accumulate about $393,676 in super, $151,000 below the level defined as a “comfortable retirement” by the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia.
The research adds to growing calls to pay more parental leave to both parents and pay superannuation on paid parental leave, demands being pursued by the Greens including in a Senate work and care committee inquiry to report on Thursday.
The Centre for Future Work report’s other recommendations are for greater family-friendly work practices and access to free or more affordable earlier childhood education and care, because lower participation among women and part-time work to balance work and care also drive lower retirement savings.
Labor’s bill expanding access to PPL and encouraging parents to share care to promote gender equality passed the House of Representatives on Monday, with PPL set to be increased to 20 weeks.
But the government rejected Greens amendments to bring forward the date the entitlement will reach 26 weeks, slated for 2026.

The Centre for Future Work found that the gender gap occurs across all occupations and industries.
Men have higher average salaries than women in 95% of all occupations, including those where women dominate the workforce. For example, women account for 99% of all midwives, and yet are paid on average 19% less.
There are about 80 occupations in which men make up 80% or more of the workforce and that workers receive an average salary above $100,000.
By contrast, no occupations in which women make up 80% or more of the workforce pay an average salary above $100,000.
Eliza Littleton, a senior economist from the Centre for Future Work, said “there’s been a noisy political debate about super in Australia for the past week, but this data shows that based on median income data Australian women will earn $136,000 less than their male counterparts over their working life”.
“When you consider that the average super balance in Australia right now is approximately $150,000, that’s a huge disparity,” she said. “Australian women continue to be paid less than men on average across all industries and occupations, costing us more than $3bn across the economy each week.”
The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia also called on the government to reinvest some of the revenue generated by the proposed less generous tax concessions on earnings on balances above $3m.
The Asfa senior policy adviser, Helena Gibson, said “as we celebrate International Women’s Day, Asfa is calling for long overdue action to protect the retirement outcomes of women who take time out of the workforce” including super on PPL and a $5,000 bonus payment into a mother’s super account per child.
The federal government paying super on PPL is estimated to cost $200m to the budget. The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, said the measure was still on the table for the May budget , but despite agreeing in principle Labor has never set a timeline for the commitment.
Super fund Hesta released new modelling by Laneway Analytics estimating that Australian mothers have missed out on more than $2.8bn in super savings at retirement from taking time out of the workforce to have children.
The estimate is based on the total benefit at the end of 2022 if super had been paid on PPL since it was introduced in 2011.
The Hesta chief executive, Debby Blakey, said mothers would “keep losing thousands of dollars in retirement savings each year this important equity reform is delayed”.
“Our super system is one of the world’s best but clear, persisting gaps remain where millions of Australians, mainly women, are still falling through the cracks and not getting the full benefits of super.
“For women this means they are still retiring with around a third less super than men.”

‘Keep working like nothing is wrong’: women make the case for paid menstruation leave
The majority of working women suffer period pain so great it affects their performance – but three in four feel they can’t talk to their manager about it, according to the preliminary findings of a survey of Australia’s biggest unions.
The survey, conducted by law firm Maurice Blackburn on behalf of the Australian Workers Union, the Transport Workers Union, the Rail, Tram and Bus Union (RBTU) and the United Workers Union, is part of a national campaign to introduce menstrual and menopausal leave.
About a thousand members of the unions have responded to the survey so far, with 75% saying they suffer from painful periods.
Of that subset, 73% said their periods were so painful they either struggled to focus or it affected their ability to perform their work.
Despite this, 74% said they did not feel comfortable talking to their line manager about taking leave or requesting flexible work arrangements to manage their symptoms.
About 34% said they didn’t think their manager would understand, another third said it could impact negatively on their career or how they were viewed in the workplace. One in five feared they wouldn’t be believed.
Sarah Love, a disability support worker based in Adelaide, suffers from endometriosis and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. She told the survey she would find it difficult to disclose her diagnosis at work “for fear of being treated unfairly”.
“Most people do not understand the intensity of what I experience and I would feel like my managers and colleagues would judge me as weak or [a] hypochondriac,” she said.
“I am afraid that if people knew, they may not afford me the opportunities that I know I can rise to most of the month. I am very good at my job, and I have pushed myself during these painful times to go on, but the toll on my mental health, productivity and self worth can be huge.”

Another respondent, the Melbourne-based architect Katie Checken, also suffers from endometriosis. After surgery in 2021, she negotiated a flexible work arrangement of four days a week with at least one day in the office, but is now feeling pressure to return more often.
“With the majority of my bosses being male, having your period is definitely not an excuse for not coming to work,” she said.
“To me, it’s crazy that 50% of the population bleeds – sometimes heavily – every month, yet we are supposed to keep working like nothing is wrong.”
Others spoke of debilitating symptoms: “At its worst, I can’t do anything. I can’t think, I can’t sit, and I can barely breathe. I find myself in tears at my desk, trying to focus on the task at hand,” an anonymous communications professional in Brisbane said.
“During my last period, the nausea was so bad that I was constantly vomiting and almost ended up in the hospital; I was home for five days and had to utilise half my sick leave for the year.”
Women suffering perimenopause and menopause symptoms were also surveyed though they represented only about a quarter of respondents.
Two-thirds said it affected their ability to perform, with the majority suffering symptoms either daily (36%) or multiple times a week (36%).
Jessica Heron, a lawyer at Maurice Blackburn who is leading the survey, said she was concerned that women with menopause may be retiring early out of fear of having to cope with their symptoms in the workplace.
A farm worker in Queensland currently going through menopause said most women in her industry retired at her age.
“I love what I do and I need to keep working. It would be great if I could have a bit of flexibility with my manager so that on particularly hard days I could alter my working hours to make the symptoms more bearable,” she told the survey.
Heron said retiring early could have a negative impact on women’s wellbeing and sense of purpose, and adversely affect their superannuation balance.
The national peak superannuation body, the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees (AIST), released a report in October showing that just over a quarter of working women were retiring under the age of 55, four years earlier than planned.
Almost 50% of these women cited personal “sickness, injury or disability” as their reason for retiring. It’s estimated to cost women more than $17bn in lost earnings and superannuation.
Heron said existing leave provisions under the Fair Work Act were insufficient.
She said the most effective way to combat this was to enshrine an extra 12 days of leave a year in the Fair Work Act for workers who suffered painful periods or menopause symptoms – similar to the family and domestic violence leave policy introduced this year.
“The current menstrual taboo is harming women as they suffer in silence. Creating menstrual policies will result in happier workplaces for everyone,” Heron said.
Sydney-based underwear company Modibodi introduced paid menstruation, menopause and miscarriage leave in May 2021 , allowing staff up to 10 days a year, while retail super fund Future Super provides six days .
Gender equality agency Victorian Women’s Trust introduced 12 days of menstrual leave more than five years ago and found there was “positive take up” without “disruption” .
In February, Spain passed laws enshrining five days of menstrual leave for women who have incapacitating periods.
Carla Jones, the principal industrial and women’s officer at the RBTU, said it was important to “right the ship”.
“The massive body of employment law that exists has largely been built on the back of a male-only workforce,” she said.
Surveying is expected to continue until June before the full results are made public.

Happy International Women’s Day! Unfortunately you still earn $1m less than men
I nternational Women’s Day is a time to celebrate the achievements of women across the world but it is also a time to acknowledge the discrimination that women continue to face in the workplace and beyond. It is a level of discrimination that results in women in Australia being paid at least $1m less than a man throughout their working life.
In a new report , my colleague at the Australia Institute’s Centre for Future Work, Eliza Littleton, and I have found some pretty jaw-dropping instances of how large and widespread the pay gap remains, detailed in a new report.
The gender pay gap is the percentage difference between men’s and women’s pay, but the problem is how to count it. Hourly or weekly? Full-time ordinary earnings, full-time total earnings, average earnings or median earnings?
For example, the hourly pay gap (what people are paid per hour) for women aged 25-34 is 3.9%, but the weekly pay gap (what they are paid in a week) is 18.8%:

But whatever way you measure it the gap remains.

This adds up, conservatively, to women being paid about $1m less than the median male earner during their working lives (in today’s money). I say conservatively because this data is using weekly earnings extrapolated into annual incomes, which means we are likely overstating how much women are paid.
This estimate also assumes a woman works throughout her entire working life without taking time off, which we also know is not typical.
So, when we say women are paid $1m less, that really is “at least”.
But gender pay gaps are not just about income. The tyranny of the pay gap carries on into retirement, because it affects how much you have in your superannuation.
Using the median income figures above and Asic’s superannuation calculator , we can estimate that a woman on the female median income will retire with about $137,000 less in her super balance than a man who has been on the male median income at all stages of his working life.
One problem is that work traditionally done by women is valued less than work traditionally done by men. This is the problem of “gender segregation”, which occurs in occupations and industries where the vast majority of workers are either men or women.
Our report uses tax data from 2019-20 to analyse the 1,032 occupations with more than 50 people working in them (excluding trainees and apprentices). This enables a more granular examination of gender pay gaps than with ABS data.
We found there were 80 occupations with an average income above $100,000 and where men made up more than 80% of all workers.
How many occupations were there where women made up more than 80% and that also had an average salary above $100,000? Zero.

But it’s not as simple as getting women to shift into male-dominated occupations. There is not just a segregation of women across occupations, but within them as well: women earn less because they get fewer hours and because they are less likely to be promoted to higher paying roles.
In 95% of all occupations, men have a higher average income (represented by the dots above the 45-degree line below).
If the graph does not display click here
This is not because these occupations have more men in them. Men still have a higher average salary in 87% of the occupations where women make up more than 60% of the workforce.

The stark examples are at the extremes. Plumber is the most male-dominated occupation, while midwife is the most female-dominated one.
Men have a higher average salary in both:

A major issue is women leaving work to raise children – more likely to be done by women than men. Women are also more likely to do unpaid work in a household than men (even if both work).
This creates a perception that affects the ability of women to get promoted. Women are much less likely to be employed as a manager. Even in healthcare and education, where women account for the large majority of workers, they are underrepresented among managers in those industries:

Our report shows that things have improved and the gender pay gap is closing, but it remains at least 30 years from disappearing if we continue at the same pace.
So long as women are expected to do most of the unpaid work because they earn less than men, they will continue to be given less and lower paid work. And the cycle will continue.

MP Georgie Purcell: Why I’m wearing my gendered online abuse to Victoria’s parliament
The day I delivered my inaugural speech in the Victorian parliament, I walked out relieved and immediately checked my phone. I saw the first Twitter notification.
“Whoreable person.”
I put it down, hugged my family and friends and accepted congratulations. I wasn’t going to let the pervasive nature of cyberhate take the moment away from me.
Despite only being elected for a mere three months, my response to online threats and harassment has already become somewhat sterilised, almost robotic. It has happened too many times before to keep track of everything said. It used to sting me a lot more.
Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup
Over recent years, our Houses of Parliament have been portrayed as unsafe spaces for women and other gender diverse politicians and staffers. This can certainly be true: some women – who are readily attack​​ed for doing so – continue to expose the harassment and even sexual abuse they’ve faced in the halls of power.
But perhaps the place we’re most consistently at danger is one we must carry around with us, everywhere we go – slid into our pockets or pushed into our bags.
The threats we receive on our phones through emails, text messages and social media are ever-constant to the point we build up a resilience that should be considered unhealthy.
Every politician, regardless of gender, expects to be challenged on their policy. As we should be. Yet for women, it consistently goes beyond politics. It goes to the personal.
You shouldn’t need to have a thick skin to be a woman who can survive in politics (or any male-dominated workplace).
So today, on International Women’s Day, I’m wearing my online harassment to work by donning a dress to Parliament House adorned with just some of the tweets, emails and comments I’ve received since being elected.
Despite the online abuse I receive being particularly vile and misogynistic – due to my past as a stripper – my situation is not unique. The scars and damage of online harassment to female politicians are a burden across party lines.
It’s something we share together, sometimes even laugh about. There’s a shared camaraderie among the alarming ping of a phone notification, the rolling of the dice between what could be an update on a proposed bill, or a sexually charged death threat. Because what more can we do? The situation feels powerless, and the internet makes us accessible in a way we can’t control.
But it doesn’t need to be this way, and it mustn’t be. Last year, Gender Equity Victoria wrote a report titled Gendered Online Harassment of Women in Politics . It included recommendations for online safety for women working in politics in Victoria.
The report found that online gendered violence and cyberhate is a norm in politics. Participants described being frequently abused via social media, phone and email. Perhaps most pertinently, it found the online harassment of women is damaging democracy.
A healthy democracy requires a diversity of voices, but a rational fear of normalised abuse against women, with no tool to stop it, is deterring women and gender-diverse people away from running for public office, and from being able to withstand it and be their most effective once they’re in. We’d much rather spend our time on positive social change than on emptying our inboxes of violent threats, sexist comments and attacks.
The report recommended mandatory training and development around online safety at work, for perpetrators of online abuse to be held accountable, the allocation of more staff members to assist with social media management, and for the online safety of women to be considered a collective, not individual, responsibility. These recommendations are all important, and should be implemented.
But the most important thing is changing the narrative around how women – no matter what they do for work or who they are – are treated online. Last year, The Global Institute for Women’s Leadership found that Australian men rank among the most misogynistic in the western world. Stopping this disturbing trend starts with the very men responsible, and it’s clear we have a long way to go.
That’s why I’ve decided to put a face – a person, someone with lived experience of mental ill-health – to those words that I receive each and every day, and that I drag with me like weights on the worst days. Maybe it will make just one of those who send these messages reconsider.
Ironically, the moment the parliamentary bells ring for the day’s session to begin, I need to take the dress off and change into a different, more “appropriate” outfit. The language I am wearing, even silently, is considered unparliamentary, and could be breaking the rules of the House.
If I can’t wear it, why aren’t we doing more to stop them saying it?

The week in audio: International Women’s Day; The Last Bohemians; Tonight With Andrew Marr
International Women’s Day Scala Radio , BBC Radio 3 , BBC 6 Music The Last Bohemians House of Hutch Tonight With Andrew Marr LBC
International Women’s Day last Tuesday, and radio stations filled the airwaves with music and interviews from “queens” and “trailblazers” and “inspirational” women; all great, but it does make me wonder about those of us who muddle along being not very magnificent at all. Women still have to be fantastic, even on IWD. It’s often said, but we’ll know we’re equal once a woman is allowed to be as mediocre at her job as a middle-aged white man. As for being rewarded with a knighthood for being sacked … nobody would want a world where that could happen. Oh.
Anyway. Scala Radio , which always showcases an admirable amount of female composers and musicians, had a good week. Simon Mayo, a natural feminist ally, was as relaxed as ever, highlighting Dame Kiri Te Kanawa’s birthday; Penny Smith had an interview with the soprano Gabriella Di Laccio. The station has also brought back She Scores , the Sunday night show featuring female film, TV and video game composers.
Radio 3, which also has a pretty good gender balance, went all out: premiering the lost 1583 madrigals of Maddalena Casulana , exploring sisters in Free Thinking , and showcasing female composers in a live lunchtime concert . This committed focus on women’s work in classical music is amazingly interesting. The station also made some lovely short videos that highlighted the various roles of women behind the scenes; encouraging stuff when we remember that just 10 years ago , only 1% of radio programme editors nationally were women.
6 Music has long had two women installed in the mornings, Lauren Laverne and Mary Anne Hobbs , both of whom regularly play music created by women; thus, despite the station’s promotion of International Women’s Day, both shows sounded as they always do – meaning as great as ever. Hobbs provided my full-on “Hooray, women are great!” moment, by playing PJ Harvey’s wild, hilarious 50ft Queenie straight into the mad scales of Anna Meredith’s Sawbones . Sometimes talk isn’t what’s needed, just an enormous shout at the sky.
For something more intelligent than sky-shouting, you might try the first episode of series three of The Last Bohemians . Kate Hutchinson’s interview podcast is always worth a listen, and she kicks off with a doozy: the brilliant artist Maggi Hambling . Hambling, an iconoclast from her wild hair to her cigarette tip, is a quote machine and a hoot, and she did not disappoint. At one point her phone went off. Its ringtone was God Save the Queen, played on a trumpet. Hutchinson, who did well not to laugh, asked Hambling: “Are you a royalist, Maggi?” “Of course,” said Hambling airily, and immediately returned to her tales of “drugs, a lot of queer business”, debauchery and art.
Like many older interviewees, she has a habit of repeating entertaining but well-worn anecdotes, but Hutchinson did well in pinning her down. When Hambling trotted out a familiar quote about her lover Henrietta Moraes – “I became her subject rather than she mine” – Hutchinson asked what she meant and got a touching story about Moraes’s death. We should all be more Hambling, I feel: saved by her work, full of doubt but continuing on. “I refuse to be told what to do,” she said. Amen.
Over to LBC, which did nothing much at all for IWD ( Shelagh Fogarty aside, its daytime hosts have long been resolutely male). On Monday, another chap – Andrew Marr – started his new one-hour evening show. It’s a strange one. Marr, who came to LBC with Rob Burley, exec editor of his old BBC TV programme, has simply transplanted a telly show on to the radio. If you watch it, he’s sitting at a semicircular table, giving his opening (Autocued) links straight down the barrel of a camera, cutting to footage of parliament or Ukraine. Fine: but many of us want to listen rather than watch, and Marr’s tone sounds manic to anyone expecting radio. TV is about broadcasting to the nation; radio is about talking to one person. Marr’s energy is a bit The Day Today for us listeners, and he sounds positively nuts when he throws to news or travel.
A few other points. It’s ridiculous to invite on journalists of the calibre of fellow presenter Camilla Tominey (Monday) and Pippa Crerar (Tuesday) for the entire one-hour duration of the programme and only have them say a couple of things. The show is very politico-celeb heavy – Michael Gove first night, Jeremy Hunt the next – which adds status but not much warmth. No listeners call in, not even a tweet is read out. In short, it’s very old BBC, which clearly has its merits but comes as a shock after LBC’s daytime schedule.
The station’s USP is feisty, informed, welcoming presenters who can keep to schedule while including listeners and never seeming frantic. Marr hasn’t yet acquired all of these attributes. His show feels alien, though it’s clearly meant to usher in LBC’s TV era; the brilliant Iain Dale , on after Marr, is now also hosting at the semicircular table and delivering some of his links to camera. Luckily, Dale is such a pro that you can’t notice this when you’re listening. Of course, Marr will settle into his new show, but there are already plenty of excellent radio presenters who do TV (Eddie Mair and James O’Brien come to mind), as LBC well knows. Victoria Derbyshire could do this show standing on her head, and involve the listeners too.

Heat Waves proves patience is a virtue, especially when it comes to megahits
Y ou might have heard the song Heat Waves, by Glass Animals , or maybe you haven’t. It was a UK hit, but not ubiquitous, not the kind of song you would necessarily expect to break international records. It was first released in June 2020. Last October, it peaked at number five. Glass Animals were on their way to becoming an indie-pop staple. In 2017, they were nominated for the Mercury prize, for their second album. But in the US, they have become a pop staple and there is no more indie about it.
It took 59 weeks for Heat Waves to make the journey from its arrival at number 100 in the Billboard charts to its spot at the very top and now, after more than a year, Glass Animals have a number one hit in America.
It is the slowest ascent to the top of all time and a sign of how unpredictable a hit can be right now. Star-making songs come from all sides and they come from all eras; it is increasingly difficult to work out where, when or why it will happen. Take Pavement and their album Terror Twilight , which came out in 1999. I bought it on CD at the time. The band’s biggest song on Spotify, with 68m plays, is a B-side from that era called Harness Your Hopes, which would have been one for the mega-fans, even then.
A report on Stereogum , in 2020, dug into the algorithms to suggest reasons why that particular song floated to the top, but more than 20 years later, it’s so popular that the band last week released a brand new video for it, starring one of the actors from the hit series Yellowjackets . It is thrilling, in a way, almost lawless. It’s as if a toddler has been left in charge of the music industry and is pressing the buttons at random: why not let TikTok turn Fleetwood Mac’s Dreams into one of the biggest hits of the 2020s, even though it was first released six decades ago?
At the same time, any world-conquering hit is usually a surprise. It’s unpredictable by nature. What labels think will work is rarely in line with what listeners decide has worked. That’s why artists are always asked if they saw a megahit coming and they always say they did not. Mark Ronson always says that, for a long time, he didn’t think Uptown Funk was working at all. Camila Cabello said she had to persuade her label to release the mega-hit Havana. It makes sense that few could have seen Heat Waves coming. That’s part of the story of a smash.
Sitting at the centre of a gaudy Venn diagram where celebrity gossip and sketch comedy meet is Pete Davidson, the Saturday Night Live regular who is also known for being a boyfriend to very famous women. Davidson, who was once engaged to Ariana Grande and who now goes out with the freshly divorced Kim Kardashian, has been a staple of the gossip circuit in recent weeks, after Kanye West, Kardashian’s ex-husband, depicted an avatar of Davidson being buried alive and then slapped by a skinned monkey, in two music videos for the same song.
So last week’s report in Deadline that Davidson is to star in a new comedy inspired by his own life, certainly sounds as if it has potential. The show, provisionally entitled Bupkis , is in development but has been compared to Curb Your Enthusiasm , which is a bit like me standing in front of the mirror in my pyjamas thinking about getting dressed and then comparing myself to a catwalk model in full couture.
The report says it is a “fictionalised” version of his life, but, considering the twists and turns of just the past fortnight, surely the issue isn’t what to make up, but what on earth he’s going to leave out.
A new YouGov survey , published on International Women’s Day, has revealed that, when it comes to naming female artists, British people are not necessarily at their best. Turn them upside down and shake them like a piggy bank and 30% can name three, with Tracey Emin, Barbara Hepworth and Frida Kahlo the most common artists to know. More than half of respondents said they had never been taught about female artists at school. Usually, hope lies in young people when it comes to addressing historically sexist imbalances, but not according to this survey: 84% of 18- to 24-year-olds were not up to the task.
The survey was commissioned by the art historian Katy Hessel to promote her forthcoming book, The Story of Art Without Men . As an avid watcher of quiz shows on television, these results did not surprise me. From quizzes I have learned many things, namely that Tipping Point reliably gives the best wrong answers in the game (see the contestant who answered a question about which MP had written a weight-loss memoir with “Agatha Christie”).
But what is true across the board, from University Challenge to Pointless to The Chase , is that questions about female artists strike fear into the hearts of every contestant. Either they answer a question that doesn’t specify the gender of the artist with a man’s name or their faces drop as they realise they should have used that extra hour they spent revising the periodic table to read up on Sarah Lucas or Vanessa Bell. Hessel is custodian of the excellent Great Women Artists Instagram page, which is the perfect place to start, for anyone who would like to brush up.

‘Hijab marches’ compete with Pakistan’s International Women’s Day rallies
More than 1,000 veiled women attended marches to promote Islamic values in cities across Pakistan on International Women’s Day in an attempt to counter pro-gender equality rallies.
In Islamabad and Karachi, well-attended “hijab marches”, organised by religious groups, competed with those participating in aurat – Urdu for women – rallies, which call for an end to systemic discrimination in the country.
The aurat march has been held each year on 8 March – International Women’s Day – since 2018, and organisers have faced numerous death threats as well as accusations of taking foreign funding to promote obscenity.
Last month Pakistan’s minister for religious affairs, Noor-ul-Haq Qadri, opposed the aurat march, and said it violated Islamic values. He demanded that the prime minister, Imran Khan, rename 8 March as Hijab Day, which prompted Tuesday’s counter-marches.
“Every year on our day religious Islamist parties threaten our march and oppose it, but Pakistani women will continue our struggle and we will counter this opposition for our rights,” said Farzana Bari, one of the aurat organisers.
Hira Ali, a university student from Islamabad, where men hurled stones at marchers in 2020, said: “The Islamists came out to suppress our voice and we will not allow them to oppose our right to protest and we own our public space.
“The perpetrators of violence against women often walk away without facing punishments and we will fight against the injustices,” she said.
In the past there has been controversy among conservative and religious circles over the slogans and placards used in the march, primarily: “My body, my choice” and “Stop being menstrual-phobic”.
Authorities in Lahore urged organisers to cancel the event there on security grounds, and threatened not to provide security for the marchers, but after a legal challenge in the city’s high court the march went ahead.
Fabricated videos and fake images of last year’s International Women’s Day march were circulated online and appeared on TV shows falsely accusing women of chanting blasphemous slogans, which carries the death penalty in Pakistan.
Over the past four years the aurat march organisers have claimed victories for gender equality, for example last year’s ban on the “virginity test ” for female rape victims in Punjab. But the flood of threats and online abuse have led march organisers to deactivate their social media accounts.
Last year’s Global Gender Gap Report by the World Economic Forum ranked Pakistan 153 out of 156 countries.

Nicola Sturgeon issues apology for ‘historical injustice’ of witch hunts
Nicola Sturgeon has issued a posthumous apology to the thousands of people persecuted as witches in Scotland , underlining that the deep misogyny that motivated this “colossal” injustice is something women today still have to live with.
As she responded to a petition demanding a pardon for the more than 4,000 people in Scotland – the vast majority of them women – who were accused, convicted and often executed under the Witchcraft Act of 1563, the first minister told the Scottish parliament that she was acknowledging “that egregious historic injustice” and extending a formal posthumous apology to all those who were so vilified.
Speaking during the Scottish government’s debate on International Women’s Day, Sturgeon explained: “Those who met this fate were not witches, they were people, and they were overwhelmingly women.
“At a time when women were not even allowed to speak as witnesses in a courtroom, they were accused and killed because they were poor, different, vulnerable or in many cases just because they were women.”
According to the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft , a comprehensive database of known prosecutions, between the first execution in 1479 and the last in 1727, at least 2,500 people were killed.
The moral panic around witchcraft and devil worship that convulsed post-Reformation societies across Europe and colonial America was especially fierce in Scotland, which carried out five times the European average of executions per capita.
Sturgeon described this as “injustice on a colossal scale, driven at least in part by misogyny in its most literal sense: hatred of women”.
Over the past few years, there have been growing calls for a national monument to commemorate those who died as well as a formal apology for their persecution, and campaigners on Tuesday welcomed “the first formal recognition of this terrible miscarriage of justice”.
Sturgeon told MSPs there were three reasons why this generation should say sorry for events that took places centuries ago.
“Firstly, acknowledging injustice, no matter how historic is important. This parliament has issued, rightly so, formal apologies and pardons for the more recent historic injustices suffered by gay men and by miners.
“Second, for some, this is not yet historic. There are parts of our world where even today, women and girls face persecution and sometimes death because they have been accused of witchcraft.
“And thirdly, fundamentally, while here in Scotland the Witchcraft Act may have been consigned to history a long time ago, the deep misogyny that motivated it has not. We live with that still. Today it expresses itself not in claims of witchcraft, but in everyday harassment, online rape threats and sexual violence.”
BREAKING NEWS The First @NicolaSturgeon just issued a formal apology to those people, mostly women, convicted under the Witchcraft Act on #InternationalWomensDay2022 .This is the first formal recognition of this terrible miscarriage of justice @zoevenditozzi @madisonmitchel1
Modern misogyny, intensified by an increasingly polarised public discourse and amplified by social media, had a significant impact on women now questioning whether politics and public life are safe environments for them, Sturgeon added. Sturgeon also welcomed in principle the recommendations made by Helena Kennedy’s working group on misogynist abuse , published on Tuesday morning, stating her government would respond formally as soon as possible.
She added: “This report matters beyond the detail of the specific recommendations it makes. It matters because it acknowledges and it gives powerful voice to the stark realities of everyday life for women.
“It recognises that misogyny is endemic, and that it blights the lives of women every single day.”

Camilla meets actor who played her younger self in The Crown
The Duchess of Cornwall came face to face with the actor who played her younger self in The Crown at an event to mark International Women’s Day.
The event, a reception at Clarence House, was hosted by Camilla and was attended by a range of women leading in fields such as the arts, politics and business for International Women’s Day. Emerald Fennell , who portrayed her in the Netflix series, was among those in attendance.
The Duchess of Cornwall and Fennell were seen to be in conversation for a few minutes, but when Fennell was asked about what the conversation involved, she said: “You know what – I’m going to be very discreet, because if I’ve learned anything it’s ‘loose lips sink ships’.”
The Duchess of Cornwall’s speech, which called on women to “share their stories” in order to bring about a more equal world, addressed Fennell directly.
“It is reassuring to know that, if I should fall off my perch at any moment, my fictional alter ego is here to take over,” the Duchess said to laughter from the audience. “So, Emerald, be prepared!”
Fennell said their meeting was “absolutely delightful”.
“She is such an impressive person, it was fittingly nice to meet her today on International Women’s Day because she does so much for so many particularly female-centred charities,” Fennell said. “She’s been in the spotlight for a long time and has always weathered it with a lot of grace and good humour.”
She added: “I was nervous I might be thrown in the tower but so far so good.”
The event, which marked International Women’s Day, also featured a moving speech by Inna Prystaiko, the wife of the Ukrainian ambassador to the UK, in which she spoke about the experience of women during the invasion.
While holding back tears, Prystaiko said: “Today there are no smiles and no peace, just horror and sorrow in the eyes of every Ukrainian woman, mother and wife.”
She added: “Now we have to count the death toll of our people and watch their frightened, crying children who are forced to flee their native land with their mothers and sisters, leaving their fathers to defend our country.”
The Crown has previously faced controversy regarding whether the show was historically accurate, with the former culture secretary Oliver Dowden urging the company to add a disclaimer that the show was fiction. Netflix responded that they had no intention of doing so.

UK government rejects request by thousands of women to examine childcare costs
Tens of thousands of women who asked the government to look into cripplingly expensive childcare costs in the UK had their demands for an inquiry rejected by the government on International Women’s Day.
A petition calling for an independent review of childcare funding and affordability gathered 113,713 signatures, and triggered a debate on childcare in parliament.
But at 3.36am on International Women’s Day those that had signed the petition were told the government had no plans to look into the cost and availability of childcare in an email from the petitions committee, which published the government’s response to its report on the ongoing impact of Covid-19 on new parents.
In September last year a survey shared with the Guardian revealed that 96% of more than 20,000 working parents said ministers were not doing enough to support parents with the cost and availability of childcare while 97% said childcare in the UK was too expensive.
The survey revealed low-income parents and those on universal credit were resorting to using food banks as a result of the high cost of childcare.
The petitions committee stated that government response also “fails to commit” dedicated catch-up funding to deal with the backlog in parental mental health and health visiting services and “repeats the government’s commitment, originally given in its response to the committee’s first report on this issue, to strengthening redundancy protections for new and expectant mothers, but again fails to set a timetable for doing so”.
The government said it had announced £500m in the 2021 autumn spending review for early years services, including mental health services for new parents. It added: “Tax-free childcare is a great offer for working parents.”
In its response to the committee, the Department for Education said the need for a review had been debated twice and while the government “recognised the need for ongoing collaboration and discussion on the issue” it had been “collectively concluded that a formal review is not needed”.
Joeli Brearley , the founder of Pregnant Then Screwed, said it was “quite astounding” that the news had been delivered on International Women’s Day.
“Affordable childcare is a critical component of gender equality. Without it hundreds of thousands of mothers are forced out of their jobs, whilst 84% say that the cost of childcare has had a negative impact on their ability to progress their career,” she said. “We will never have gender equality whilst women cannot afford to go to work. Happy International Women’s Day to you too!”
According to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the UK has the third most expensive childcare system in the world, behind only Slovakia and Switzerland; a full-time place costs £12,376 a year on average.
Analysis released on Tuesday by Scottish Widows reveals that women retiring after 65 will save half as much money as men. Time out of the workplace and part-time work mean the average woman will need to work an extra 37 years to give her the same pension pot as a male counterpart.

International Women’s Day marked with events around the world – as it happened
That it! I’m wrapping up our International Women’s Day blog for another year. Thank you to everyone who contacted me today to tell me about how they were marking the day, and thanks for keeping me company if you have been a reader.
If you emailed and I didn’t post, I’m sorry! But no apologies to the approximately 4,000 PRs who emailed me to use the day for a bit of free publicity, who I completely ignored.
See you all next year!
Women in the occupied Palestinian territories continue to face many challenges in asserting their rights, thanks to both Israeli human rights violations and systemic discrimination within Palestinian society.
Data released by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics on Monday showed that while women outperform men in terms of educational attainment, just 17% of women participate in the workforce, and women only make up 11% of the Palestinian National Council, the highest decision making body in Ramallah. A total of 31 Palestinian women are currently being held in the Israeli prison system, which allows the authorities to detain people without charge or trial with no time limit.
On International Women’s Day, we recognise & salute the strong Palestinian women who face systemic violence & discrimination from Israeli forces on a daily basis.

MPs, football groups and equality organisations have signed an open letter to the Premier League and FA calling on them to “meaningfully tackle gender-based violence”.
Organised by The End Violence Against Women Coalition, Level Up and The Three Hijabis, signatories include Caroline Nokes MP, Chair of Women and Equalities Select Committee, the frontman of the band Chumbawumba - famous for their football anthem Tubthumping, the Football Supporters Association and many organisations dedicated to ending inequality and supporting survivors of sexual violence and abuse.
I wrote about the letter, which urges the organisations to decide “which side they are on when it comes to violence against women and girls” last month:
A misogyny act for Scotland, created exclusively for women to crack down on street harassment, organised online hate and an onslaught of rape and disfigurement threats, has been recommended to the Scottish government by Helena Kennedy .
Set up in February 2021 to consider the creation of a standalone offence of misogynist hate crime, Lady Kennedy’s working group has returned a far more ambitious report that recommends naming explicitly the daily abuses that “absolutely degrade women’s lives”.
Speaking exclusively to the Guardian as she launches the report, Kennedy says she aims to use law as a tool for cultural change, shift the dial to focus on perpetrator rather than women’s behaviour, and set the bar for change across the rest of the UK.

The Government said it had announced £500m in the 2021 Autumn Spending Review for early years services, including mental health services for new parents. It added that: “Tax-Free Childcare is a great offer for working parents”.
In its response to the committee the Department for Education said the need for a review had been debated twice and while the government “recognised the need for ongoing collaboration and discussion on the issue” it was “collectively concluded that a formal review is not needed”.
Joeli Brearley , founder of Pregnant Then Screwed, said:
It is quite astounding that the Government has chosen International Women’s Day to email 114,000 women who signed our petition demanding affordable childcare, to say they won’t be conducting an independent review of the childcare sector.
Affordable childcare is a critical component of gender equality. Without it hundreds of thousands of mothers are forced out of their jobs, whilst 84% say that the cost of childcare has had a negative impact on their ability to progress their career.
Women do the majority of the unpaid care work that keeps our society spinning and ensures men can progress their career. This work saves our economy billions of pounds.
It is a massive kick in the teeth to hear that the Government expects us to continue doing this work for free and that they will not invest further in the vital social infrastructure that is our childcare sector. We will never have gender equality whilst women cannot afford to go to work. Happy International Women’s Day to you too!
Kizzy Gardiner, who became the UK’s first Locum MP when she covered for Stella Creasy said she had got the news while doing a 3am feed with her baby. She said:
Waking up at 3am to feed a baby is exhausting. Waking up at 3am on IWD to an email from the government to say they’re not doing an independent review in to childcare is absolutely infuriating.
Childcare costs are crippling. To get this from the government speaks volumes about how little value they place on working families.
According to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the UK has the third most expensive childcare system in the world, behind only Slovakia and Switzerland; a full-time place costs £12,376 a year on average.
Analysis released on Tuesday by Scottish Widows revealed that women retiring after 65 will save half as much money as men. Time out of the workplace and part-time work mean a woman will need to work an extra 37 years to give her the same pension pot as a man.
Absolutely love these pictures from the 1971 women’s Liberation Movement march - there is a dead ringer for my mum when she was a young woman! You can own one of them too, which is quite cool .

A group of Ukrainian women sheltering from the shelling in a basement in Kharkiv have, for the first time, sent an International Women’s Day message of love and support to the men they love, writes my colleague Diane Taylor.
Usually men are not mentioned much on International Women’s Day., but today the message from the bunker states:
Dear women, May your children and your beloved men be alive, may all love creatures on this planet be happy. May there be peace in the world. May there be light. Take care of yourselves and your loved ones.
Another international Women’s Day message has been written by a child on the poster on the left of this photo in a kitchen in western Ukraine providing food for internally displaced refugees.

Happy 8th March to the women cooks
The Ukrainian woman who shared this photo and message said:
The spirit of of all Ukrainians is alive and strong on International Women’s Day.
Sobering message Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on International Women’s Day, which is an important official holiday in Russia and Ukraine dating back from the Soviet era.
Women are often feted with flowers, chocolates and declarations of love, but of course this year has been utterly overshadowed by the tragedy in Ukraine.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy opened his morning video address Tuesday with these heartfelt and devastating words:
Ukrainians, we usually celebrate this holiday, the holiday of spring. We congratulate our women, our daughters, wives, mothers. Usually. But not today.
Today I cannot say the traditional words. I just can’t congratulate you. I can’t, when there are so many deaths. When there is so much grief, when there is so much suffering. When the war continues.
Over in the US president Joe Biden has said that he will ask Congress for $2.6 billion for foreign aid programs that promote gender equality worldwide, more than double the size of last year’s request.
The Associated Press have this dispatch:
Biden announced his intentions on International Women’s Day , which is set aside to celebrate the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women around the world.
Biden created the first-ever White House Gender Policy Council last year to help promote gender equity throughout the administration.
He said everyone deserves to live up to their “God-given” potential, regardless of gender, and that societies perform better when women and girls are allowed to prosper.
In a written statement Biden said:
Ensuring that every woman and girl has that chance isn’t just the right thing to do — it’s also a strategic imperative that advances the prosperity, stability, and security of our nation and the world.
The White House also was hosting a livestreamed International Women’s Day event to discuss the announcement, featuring Secretary of State Antony Blinken from Europe, acting budget director Shalanda Young, U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Samantha Power and Jen Klein, director of the Gender Policy Council. They are to be joined by young women leaders from Ukraine, Brazil, Zambia, Burma, Jordan and the United States. Biden was not scheduled to participate.
Jill Biden marked the day with a video tribute to women throughout the world “who courageously use their voice, no matter the cost.”
She said:
To our sisters from Ukraine who are fighting to keep their country free and their families alive: We stand with you in solidarity. To our sisters in Russia who are protesting and speaking out against the invasion at great personal risk: We see your courage.
And to women warriors around the world, those fighting for justice and working for change: Thank you for building a better future for all of us.
Another UK Government announcement today, this time from the Government Equalities Office, who have promised initiatives to level the playing field for women applying for jobs.
According to the GEO “participating employers will run pilots aimed at closing salary gaps by publishing salaries on all job adverts” - no information on the press release about how many employers actually are participating (I have asked).
They are also pushing a new ‘returners’ programme to support women into STEM roles after taking time out after having kids or other caring responsibilities.
This new programme will, it says, “help organisations to recruit and retain talented staff who are often overlooked because of a gap on their CV, by providing training, development and employment support to those who have taken time out for caring.”
It notes:
Unpaid care work [...] can have a big impact on pay and progression, with research showing that returners with degrees are, on average, paid 70% of the hourly wage of an equivalent colleague who has not taken time away from work.
There is not much detail in the GEO release on this though, including how many women it will help, and how it will be rolled out - and indeed how much money it will cost, and who is paying for it. If the GEO responds to my requests for further details I will report back.
IMF research shows Japan ranked 110 out of 149 in the World Economic Forum’s 2018 Gender Gap Index. At 24.5% in 2018, the gender wage gap is the second largest among OECD nations, surpassed only by South Korea. #IWD2022 https://t.co/mO4UEokJ8z
At Guardian Towers we are particularly enjoying the work of the not-for-profit Twitter bot @genderpaygap feed today, which is simply tweeting their median gender pay gap in response to any International Women’s Day tweets from company accounts.
It’s simple. It’s effective. It’s oh so pleasing.
Here’s a selection of companies who really don’t have too much to shout about when it comes to pay equality, and yet are using IWD as a means of promotion.
In this organisation, women's median hourly pay is 68.6% lower than men's. https://t.co/Vk45EVqON4
In this organisation, women's median hourly pay is 35.8% lower than men's. https://t.co/h4GMvIAtIQ
In this organisation, women's median hourly pay is 41% lower than men's. https://t.co/8WT0ybE6g7
Some companies seem to have gone as far as deleting their tweets once their gender pay gap has been pointed out to the world.
Seems like some orgs having second thoughts about tweeting about #IWD2022 when their #GenderPayGap is pointed out 👀 pic.twitter.com/lF6iSlo6Iw
Gender equality in English football is “in the dark ages” and is contributing to the sport’s failing finances, according to a new report by the Fair Game group , which is made up from 34 clubs across the pyramid.
A whopping two-thirds of England and Wales’ leading clubs have ALL-MALE boards a study by the organisation found. YEP. ALL. MALE.
Because, sure, women don’t care about football right? (As someone who has suffered under the life-long affliction of being an Everton fan, I beg to differ).
Published today Fair Game found clubs to be “hugely naive” when it comes to catering for and marketing to female fans, and that they are missing out on vital revenue as a result.
The report - catchily named ‘The Gender Divide That Fails Football’s Bottom Line: The Commercial Case for Gender Equality’ - found just 11.1% of board members at Premier League clubs were women, dropping to just 4.2% in the Championship. This compares to 39.1% on the boards of FTSE 100 companies.
This comes after the Football Association reported in November that clubs and governing bodies signed up to the Football Leadership Diversity Code (FLDC) had collectively failed to hit any of the recruitment targets set related to women in the scheme’s first 10 months.
FLDC targets to hire females in senior leadership, team operations and women’s club coaching roles were all missed.
The Fair Game report notes that clubs are really missing a trick - as diverse boards make for more financial success and better decision making. Duh.
Dr Stacey Pope, co-author of the report and an Associate Professor at Durham University, added:
We looked at all aspects of how football operates at the moment and in a large number of cases clubs are living in the dark ages and are failing to cater adequately for 51 per cent of the population.
Preach Dr Pope.
The BBC have done a series of really interesting interviews with three “femicide detectives”.
As it notes: “femicide - the killing of women and girls because of their gender - is the most extreme form of gender-based violence, but in many countries no record is kept of the number of cases.”
The BBC spoke to Gulsum Kav in Turkey, who began a campaign to stop femicide in 2010, the year after the dead body of a teenager, Munevver Karabulut, was found in a bin in Istanbul. It took police more than six months to track down the suspect, leading to protests on the streets of Istanbul.
She and the We Will Stop Femicide Team also looked into the case of Esin Gunes, a young teacher whose body was found at the bottom of a cliff in Siirt province, south-eastern Turkey, in August 2010.
The BBC reports:
Esin’s husband said they had gone to the area for a walk and a picnic, and she had slipped to her death. While the authorities initially accepted this story, the family didn’t, as Esin had only recently returned to her husband after walking out and saying she wanted a divorce.
Gulsum’s team commissioned a report which proved it was not physically possible to fall in the way she did and that she must have been thrown. This led to her husband’s conviction for murder, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
Since that first case, the team has worked on over 30 suspected femicides.
Read the full story here .
In the UK, the government’s big IWD announcement centres around the launch of a “global business partnership” to improve girls’ access to education and employment in developing countries by providing high quality skills training.
Here’s the gist of it:
Touted as “the UK’s first education partnership of its kind” - the government is teaming up with the private sector to boost girls’ access to education, working in partnership with UNICEF’s Generation Unlimited (GenU) to help deliver the programme.
Businesses, charities, schools and colleges will be able to bid for funds from the programme, with a focus on providing the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) skills needed to find work in key sectors such as technology and manufacturing.
Initially bids will be encouraged for projects in Nigeria and Bangladesh, two countries where significant barriers to girls’ education remain.
Boris Johnson said:
The United Kingdom has long been a proud and mighty champion of this fundamental cause and today we take one leap further through our first Global Partnership of its kind - opening the opportunity for one million girls across the developing world to have access to high quality skills training.
Ensuring every girl and young woman across the globe receives 12 years of quality education is the greatest tool in our armoury to end the world’s great injustices.
Delivering on this mission will be one of the best defences against ignorance, ensure the greatest protection from prejudice and put a rocket booster behind our hopes and dreams for global development in the years to come.
The issue of men’s violence against women is a huge topic on any International Women’s Day, but this year has seen a particular focus on the issue - particularly in the UK where the rape and murder of Sarah Everard sparked a national debate that is ongoing.
I spoke to the new national police lead Maggie Blyth yesterday, just before she got on a flight to attend a IWD event in Dublin.
It was an interesting conversation, because unlike the former Metropolitan policer chief Cressida Dick Blyth was very candid about the extent of the problems with sexism and misogyny in the police force. She admitted that the police can attract some men who want to use the powers of being a police officer “to exert and coerce” vulnerable people - even while vehemently insisting that the vast majority of the force are horrified by the actions of some of those in their ranks.
Here’s an extract:
Policing attracts some men who want “to exert and coerce” vulnerable people, the new national police lead on violence against women has admitted, as she urged officers to create a “call-out culture” to tackle sexist and misogynistic behaviour.
Deputy chief constable Maggie Blyth, who took up the post of national lead for violence against women and girls (VAWG) at the National Police Chiefs’ Council five months ago, said it was wrong to dismiss abusive, violent or sexist officers as a “few bad apples”.
She added that policing scandals of the past 12 months, including the rape and murder of Sarah Everard by a serving police officer, had been a “stark check”.
“That was so shocking to policing that it rocked the whole of the service in a way that we really hadn’t seen since the murder of Stephen Lawrence,” said Blyth in an interview with the Guardian to mark International Women’s Day on Tuesday. “It felt, and continues to feel, like a watershed moment.”
All over the world today people are celebrating International Women’s Day with a spirit of solidarity and fortitude in these uncertain times.
Today we will be liveblogging throughout the day, bringing you news of events from around the world, as well as data, research ...and your stories!
My name is Lexy Topping and I would love to hear how you are marking International Women’s Day today, so please do get in touch.

‘Courage and defiance’: female Guardian reporters on the women who inspired them
Gender-based violence is not just something I cover at work; it has also deeply affected my life. In 2017, I lost two friends, who were murdered by men. Those experiences reinforced my desire to write about the experiences and perspectives of women in the countries I have covered in the Middle East; highlighting the remarkable strength and resilience of women and girls I have met in the region is a powerful antidote.
Fidan Ataselim in Istanbul is one of these women. She is one of the founders of the Turkish campaign group We Will Stop Femicide , a group of women fighting tooth and nail to bring down Turkey’s shockingly high – and climbing – levels of violence against women.
Turkish civil society faces a climate of repression under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s conservative government. It is increasingly difficult to stage large-scale protests but, despite that, Ataselim organises rallies, lobbies politicians and provides support for victims and their families, which is sorely lacking from the state. Part of her work also involves compiling data on femicide deaths, since Ankara does not keep records.
Basic rights and protections won by Turkish women are increasingly under threat. Last year, the country withdrew from a landmark European legal convention designed to protect victims of male violence and prosecute offenders more effectively over fears that provisions for LGBTQ+ individuals dilute traditional “family values”.
But despite the very real possibility of arrest, imprisonment and death threats, Ataselim keeps going. As she once told me: “More women are demanding their right to work and go to university. The more choices we have, the more intense the backlash gets.” Bethan McKernan is the Jerusalem correspondent for the Guardian
After spending three days shadowing Sandra Santos, a healthcare professional who specialises in educating young people about HIV in São Paulo, I was floored by her passion and determination. Santos works at Emilio Ribas hospital, one of the biggest infectious diseases centres in Brazil, and has dedicated her life to helping and empowering young people who live with HIV.
Her job transcends the hospital walls; when I was there in January 2020, she was helping a group of patients, who had contracted the virus from their mothers, to set up their own organisation to educate others about HIV. She was also negotiating access into some of the city’s favelas to reach the most vulnerable people, who often have limited access to health services.
It was clear that those she helped were more than patients to her; she told me that, one year, 17 people she had worked with died and how hard it was to go from a funeral to a birthday party.
She is tough, but also sensitive and incredibly caring. I really admire her strength and resolve. It was only on the last day when we were saying our goodbyes that she broke down in tears, revealing a little of the toll of working with a group of people who are so often forgotten and maligned by society. Sarah Johnson is a Global Development reporter for the Guardian
I have come across so many fantastic women in Italy while doing my job, from chefs and politicians to doctors and professors, it is difficult to choose one who has inspired me the most. But someone who made an impact over the last year is Debora Porrà, the mayor of Villamassargia, a town in southern Sardinia. Porrà, in her second term of office, is among a group of female mayors in Sardinia who campaign for women’s rights – and who put their words into action.
I first interviewed her for a story about Italy’s declining birthrate. Her town has one of the lowest birthrates in the country, and she told me how the group had managed to delay the closure of the maternity unit in the province’s only hospital – in Italy there has to be 500 births a year at a hospital for funding to be maintained. They were also fighting for women to get access to pain-free births, as provision of epidural pain relief is not common in Sardinia.
I kept in touch with Porrà and asked if she could recommend somewhere to stay when I visited Sardinia for work last summer. I was surprised, and obviously overjoyed, to be lined up with a place by the beach, and then invited to celebrate her birthday at a lunch with family and friends. Porrà is not only an inspiration and passionate about improving lives, but one of the kindest people I’ve met in Italy. Angela Giuffrida is the Guardian’s Rome correspondent
On 3 March 2021, Kyal Sin, known as Angel, joined a demonstration against Myanmar’s military junta on the streets of Mandalay, the country’s second-largest city. She wore a black, oversized T-shirt that read: “Everything will be OK.”
It was about a month after the military had seized power, and security forces were using increasingly deadly violence against protesters . She was aware of the dangers she might face. Beforehand, she had shared details of her blood group on Facebook, as well as an emergency contact and a request for her organs to be donated.
She was shot dead when police opened fire.
Kyal Sin was a talented and caring 19-year-old. She was skilled at taekwondo, a gifted dancer and quick-witted. A friend who protested alongside her told Reuters at the time that she had kicked open a water pipe at the rally, so that others could rinse teargas from their eyes.
A photograph of her at the rally that day – crouching forward, a pair of goggles slung around her neck to protect from teargas – was shared widely online, along with the words: “Everything will be OK.” Her image was immortalised in protest artwork.
She is one of many young women who have risked violence, and even given their lives, to fight for democracy. Other young women have joined the People’s Defence Force and other armed groups, taking up arms to protect their communities against military violence and to fight for justice in Myanmar.
The military has only become more brutal in its use of violence against the public, but she remains a symbol of courage and defiance. Rebecca Ratcliffe is the Guardian’s south-east Asia correspondent
Abortion has never been fully accessible in Poland during my lifetime. I was born five years after the initial restrictions were introduced in 1992, and grew up in a family where, as earnest Catholics, we would tear up at the mention of the “murdered unborn”.
Being viscerally aware of the chokehold that anti-choice rhetoric has had on Polish society, the work of Krystyna Kacpura , a veteran of the Polish feminist movement, is particularly close to my heart.
Kacpura has been involved in the movement from the very beginning. She was one of the first employees of the Federation for Women and Family Planning, which was set up in 1991. Abortion was still legally available on demand then, but it was clear that in the new Poland those rights were not a given. And as politicians and clergy discussed the “appropriate” limits of reproductive health, women’s voices were not heard or taken seriously.
But despite the series of setbacks that Polish women have experienced over the last three decades, Kacupura has worked tirelessly. Today, she is still taking phone calls from desperate women, offering them level-headed and clear advice that they will often not hear from their doctor. Her decades of work have laid the foundations for Poland’s feminist protest movement of today. Weronika Strzyżyńska is a Guardian reporter
As one of only a few female journalists investigating human rights and environmental issues in my country, I often ask myself: how long can I survive? Indonesia is experiencing devastating environmental destruction. As a female journalist, I also face gender discrimination and have to fight ideas that women belong in the kitchen, that women cannot lead.
I was considering giving up my job until I met Eva Bande. I was interviewing her for a documentary I was making. Bande has risen to lead social movements, including a group of farmers resisting a giant palm-oil plantation, owned by a powerful local elite. She has faced violence and imprisonment.
It is unusual to see a female leader and her spirit uplifted me. I witnessed her open a meeting with a group of farmers and saw that a woman can be a leader and a guardian of the forest. It was a turning point in my life. I wanted to be like her some day but, in my version, being an editor and leading a group of reporters to investigate environmental stories. It is a dream I am still working towards. Febriana Firdaus is an independent investigative journalist based in Indonesia
At the same time Saudi Arabia was pushing to vastly expand the small number of women in the workplace in 2018, it was also detaining a group of feminist activists who had demanded many of the very changes they were implementing.
One of them was Loujain al-Hathloul. Her only crime was spearheading a campaign for Saudi Arabian women to be allowed to drive . Hathloul put herself on the line, regularly and defiantly, for women who simply wanted the freedom to make basic choices about their own lives, including being able to drive a car without fear of arrest.
She remained in prison until February last year , long enough that the kingdom had lessened or removed many of the restrictions on women that she had campaigned against. The ban on women driving in Saudi Arabia was lifted just a month after her arrest .
Hathloul’s prolonged detention – during which she testified she was tortured – was less about women driving, now commonplace in Saudi Arabia, but because she spoke out. Today, she remains banned from travelling outside the country for her activism, and banned from speaking to the media.
Hathloul’s inspiring influence on Saudi women, as well as feminists worldwide, is clear, which is why her words and work represent a lasting threat. The block on Hathloul speaking publicly is designed to prevent her from demanding more for the women of Saudi Arabia – because in the end, she will succeed.

Many Sudanese women are an inspiration to me, but I want to highlight Awadiya Mahmoud Koko, a tea seller who became a trade union leader , overcoming many obstacles in her personal life and work to do so.
As a young girl, Koko fled war in South Kordofan, her birthplace, to live in the capital, Khartoum, where she worked as a tea lady, a job traditionally done by women who fled the war in Darfur and the Nuba mountains . She faced enormous discrimination in the city due to where she came from.
She has been arrested many times. Under the former president Omar al-Bashir, tea sellers were regularly harassed and arrested under public order laws. But she never gave up and went on to help form the first union for female tea sellers – a bold thing to do under Bashir’s government. She was heavily involved in the 2019 protests that led to his downfall.
I think of Koko whenever things look bleak or I think about giving up working as a journalist. Sudan places many restrictions on women from working-class backgrounds. She inspires many women here, especially those who come from the periphery of society, who look at her and believe that, one day, their hard work could be recognised.

For years, Afghanistan’s female national wheelchair basketball team crisscrossed the globe, becoming a potent symbol of how women’s lives had been transformed in the country. But in August, as the Taliban swiftly retook power, silence descended on their home basketball court in the hills of Kabul.
The team’s captain, Nilofar Bayat, scrambled to leave the country. “There were so many videos of me playing basketball. I had been active in calling for women’s rights and the rights of women with disabilities,” the 28-year-old told me in August. “If the Taliban found out all of this about me, I knew they would kill me.”
Bayat and her husband, Ramesh Naik, were offered places on a wheelchair basketball team in the northern Spanish city of Bilbao. Six months on, they continue to grapple with the immense task of rebuilding their lives; there are daily Spanish lessons, endless amounts of bureaucracy to wade through and new teammates to gel with.
Even so, Bayat’s focus remains on the women of Afghanistan. A trained lawyer, she is now working to create an association, Free Women for Afghanistan, with the aim of providing support and international advocacy for women in Afghanistan, particularly those with disabilities.
Despite fears that her family in Afghanistan could become targets, Bayat has sought to give voice to the women the Taliban is seeking to erase, speaking to anyone who will listen about the situation on the ground. “People are forgetting the women and children who are the main victims of the war in Afghanistan,” she says.

‘Women of the wild’: the platform giving India’s nature experts a voice
“I wish these things wouldn’t happen to anyone,” says Akanksha Sood Singh, a wildlife film-maker based in Delhi. “But if it has happened, this is a safe space for women to come and to share their experiences.”
The safe space Sood Singh is referring to is the Instagram account Women of the Wild – India , which showcases “the untold stories of women working for science and nature”. The platform gives them a chance to promote their expertise, but also somewhere to share their experiences of working in what are often male-dominated fields where sexual harassment can often feature.
Sood Singh, like most other professionals, attended several online programmes during the pandemic. “In many of the webinars I attended, there were no women on the panel,” she says. “If there were one or two women, they were mostly moderators.”
Around the same time, Sood Singh, who is part of an advisory group at Jackson Wild (previously known as the Jackson Hole wildlife film festival), was planning a film-making workshop for early and mid-career female Stem professionals, in partnership with the organisation. She had an extremely difficult time finding women to take part in the workshop. “I spent 10 days trying. I just lost it,” she says. “This couldn’t be happening in the 21st century.”
Angry and frustrated at the lack of female representation in various forums, Sood Singh launched the Women of the Wild – India account in May last year, followed by accounts for Pakistan and Malaysia . “It’s not at all easy for women in Pakistan,” says Sood Singh. “You have to have very open-minded parents to allow you to study science.”
Before launching the platform in India , Sood Singh emailed the 20 to 30 women that she knew working in these areas and asked them to respond to four simple questions about why they had chosen their careers, what challenges they faced when starting out, what was the one event that strengthened their resolve to continue, and what would their message be for anyone reading the post.
Environment reporter Aditi Rajagopal was the first to be featured on the Women of the Wild – India account. “When Akanksha spoke to me about her idea, I loved it! By being the first to be featured, I hoped it would make other women comfortable to put their names and faces out there,” she says. Since then, more than 400 scientists, researchers, film-makers, journalists, photographers, artists, animal rescuers and others in a wide range of professions have been profiled on the account.
They include an environmental lawyer, a youth climate leader, a member of a village forest protection squad, the founder of a plastic upcycling service and the leader of India’s largest youth movement to conserve water. Rajagopal says: “It’s heartwarming to see so many women doing incredibly important work in fields and positions I didn’t even know existed.”
Sood Singh says: “I see in the comments and DMs [direct messages] how one woman’s journey becomes a plan for another to work through her challenges.”
Followers of the account can review the institutions they work for anonymously if they prefer. A post inviting reviews of the Centre for Wildlife Studies (CWS) received more than 100 comments, many of which alleged experiences of various forms of harassment, lack of advancement opportunities and a toxic work environment.
A few days after the CWS review, Krithi Karanth, chief conservation scientist at the organisation, shared a post on the CWS Instagram account titled Working towards a safer and inclusive work environment at CWS . Karanth, who took up her role in November 2018, wrote: “This is a wake-up call for me, CWS and many others”, adding that the organisation would “address all legitimate issues raised by those who work with us”.
A review of the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) also received nearly 100 comments, with accounts of gender-based discrimination in the workplace. Bittu Sahgal, the BNHS president, responded directly to the comments, acknowledging: “It’s a systemic change that we need. It will happen.” Sahgal set out steps being taken at the BNHS to address complaints, including internal one-on-one conversations.
To date, more than 20 organisations have been reviewed on Women of the Wild – India and Sood Singh is hopeful that women coming into these organisations will experience a better environment.
“In the feedback that I receive, I see that a sense of ownership has set in with the women who follow the account,” she says. “They take this to be a very safe space. They consider it ‘their’ space.”
Women of the Wild is constantly evolving and Sood Singh hopes to set up a mentorship programme. “We still have a lot to figure out. The conversations have just started. I want to make these conversations mainstream.”
In the meantime, she says: “No one can say that they couldn’t find a woman to be on a panel of experts.”

Black Women Photographers on what International Women’s Day means to them
T he Black Women Photographers collective, established via a Covid-19 relief fund, is approaching its second year of promoting and empowering Black female photographers, as well as increasing the visibility of their work.
In March, a virtual summit supported by Adobe will feature Raven B Varona , Kimberly Douglas, aka @kihmberlie , Audrey Woulard , Lola Flash , Lola Akinmade Åkerström , Amanda J Cain , NHL’s first Black woman team photographer, Whitney Matewe , DeLovie Kwagala , Cheriss May , Sade Ndya, Chaya Howell and Idara Ekpoh .
2017: My friends Dara and Isioma, who I have known since 2008 in boarding school. This photo was taken at one of our many mini alumni meetups. After spending six years of the most formative parts of our adolescence in a remote school campus – loving, hating and knowing each other – we can say that we come from each other.
Above all else, International Women’s Day (IWD) is like all other days: every day I am a woman and every day is my day. But what I appreciate about IWD is that it is usually a call to think more about our identity as women and the boundaries we make or contest around that identity.

Yes, it becomes a marketing gimmick for brands, and I am already dreading the amount of Each for Equal/Choose to Challenge/Break the Bias campaign emails I am about to receive. Notwithstanding, for me, the day becomes a plea and a reminder for us to think more about what it means to be a woman in our various societies. While I understand and appreciate the need to celebrate women’s achievements in our misogynistic world, events that reify gender, like IWD, have become opportunities for me to think more about the role of gender. And when I am not in the mood for hard thoughts, IWD is a day to text my mum, aunties, sisters and friends that *clink-clink* emoji because, chale , it’s not easy being a woman.

I am here and alive today because of redemptions I find when I am in community with other women. The way we have learned to stand tall for ourselves, to hold each other when we can’t stand, and to tell ourselves the truth about what keeps us from standing … these are the things that have brought me here.

This photo series is titled Women and Culture and it aims to celebrate women and their connection to our culture. African women contribute greatly to the formation of culture and Yoruba fashion. The value of women in our society cannot be underestimated: they add colours and meaning to our society, homes, and offices.

To be photographed is a vulnerable act. There is a relationship that is created between myself as the photographer and the women I capture in front of the lens. I am given the opportunity to show their smile, their grace, their strength and their resilience. Today, on International Women’s Day, I celebrate every woman who has sat in front of my lens. I say thank you. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to capture part of you.

International Women’s Day to me is about recognising the impact of the women you know, know of, and aspire to be like. As I consider this, I am using this day to reflect on the impact that the women I photograph have had on me and my work.

For me, it’s a day of recognising women and camaraderie with each other and support. It means unity, it means that women from all over the world can see women do something for their own countries. It means another day for women to be celebrated. I honestly welcome any excuse to celebrate women, especially in this part of the world.

It is also a time to reflect on what is yet to be done to achieve equity and an introspection of how I can contribute to the movement in my own unique way.

Every day is women’s day to me, however International Women’s Day is the day that the whole world gets to acknowledge and celebrate women worldwide. This is the day that we celebrate being women, our impact and contribution to each and every society that we are in and or attached to. International Women’s Day also means taking stock on how far we have come with regards to women’s rights and assessing the next steps we can take to do better for women across the world.

I know one way to improve women’s lives. It involves giving more men the vote
I t’s International Women’s Day, so of course I find myself reflecting not on the plight of women, but on what I was up to on all previous IWDs. In the 90s, we celebrated it in pubs, because whether or not real women drank pints was one of feminism’s critical questions back then. I’m not kidding. It’s not even a stupid question – but we can talk about why not some other time.
Most of the 00s was lost to arguing on social media about why there wasn’t an International Men’s Day (ignoring the boring reality that it’s on 19 November ), or whether that was every other day of the year.
Then, on what has lodged in my memory as aeons before the pandemic, but was actually the blink of an eye ahead of the first lockdown, I went to Berlin for a panel discussion about what a feminist Europe would look like. The question made me miserable. We had been wading through the toxic sludge of Brexit for nearly four years, and we had just elected a government of rightwing shysters. Even if we did come up with a blueprint for an international feminist utopia, Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage would between them probably find a way to yank the UK out of it.
Plus, you almost never see a new idea spawned during a panel discussion in real time. You would be more likely to see a scientific breakthrough on Ready Steady Cook. That was my prejudice; turned out that was just because most panels don’t contain enough feminists.
So anyway, I can’t remember whose idea this was, between Saboura Naqshband, an academic and co-founder of the Berlin Muslim Feminists Collective, Daphne Büllesbach, vice-president of European Alternatives Berlin, or Prune Antoine, editor-in-chief of Sisters of Europe. All I can say for certain is that it wasn’t my idea. I’d arrived with nothing in my head besides goodwill and the aforesaid misery.
It sounds pretty simple in retrospect. There were four basic questions. What were the origins of the women’s movement? Universal suffrage. What was its international evolution? As women’s voting rights were established, it became a Peace, Land and Bread movement, and still has the campaign against poverty and conflict at its core. What are the pressing issues now? Still poverty and conflict, the displacements they both cause, plus the democratic deficits that land us with the authoritarian governments that create them. How could we loop all that together? With a new suffrage movement for the 21st century, except not for women – many of us, I can’t help but notice, already have voting rights – but for migrants.
Everyone had an example of the transformative impact it would have in various elections, if migrants were granted the vote. The Munich mayorals were just around the corner, there was something afoot in Barcelona … I wasn’t really listening because, yet again, I’d disappeared down the rabbit hole of our own referendum. What would have happened if the three 3 million EU migrants living in the UK had been able to vote in 2016? We wouldn’t be in this mess. What would happen to immigration policy – indeed, the very language around migration – if immigrants were recast as people whose votes you wanted? It might be humane. What would have happened in the 2019 general election if the long-term UK residents whose lives were about to be upended by some blowhard promising to “get Brexit done” had had a say in the matter? He wouldn’t now be prime minister.
But these sad counterfactuals weren’t really the point. It’s just morals, innit? There isn’t really a defensible civic agenda in which some people’s voices are, in perpetuity, more important than others’. Feminism was mobilised in the crucible of this understanding; if your destination is equality and justice, your route is democracy, as much of it as you can lay your hands on.
You’ll notice something counterintuitive about the plan, I’m sure. The idea wasn’t “votes for migrant women” but “votes for all migrants”. The logical endpoint for International Women’s Day would be a unisex campaign, which I do realise will bug the hell out of some people. Happy International Women’s Day!

Going places: 10 inspirational female adventurers
Rhiane launched the non-profit organisation Black Girls Hike in Bolton in 2019 to create a safe space for Black women to explore the outdoors and connect with nature. It’s now a nationwide organisation hosting hikes, training events and activity weekends, and she won a positive role model award for gender at the National Diversity Awards in 2021.
“My most memorable moment so far was our first London event in Epping Forest. We had over 100 women attend, whereas I was used to having just 10 to 15. I genuinely could not believe it. It was so powerful and affirming. Last year we had a column in Stylist magazine, worked with Bear Grylls and did a TEDx talk,” says Rhiane, “and this year we’re launching international trips.” @bgh_uk , @rhianesworld
Allie is an ultrarunner who has crossed Namibia three times, run from coast to coast in Panama, Malta, Scotland and Santorini, and run the entire length of the Outer Hebrides chain. She was a route tester for Rat Race ’s long-distance running trips, but decided to go it alone as a coach after what she describes as “a seismic mental breakdown in 2021”.
Recognising her “extremely dysfunctional and addictive relationship with alcohol” as an extremely fit and functioning alcoholic is something she writes about beautifully with humorous raw honesty. “My mission in life,” says Allie, “is to try to help people, especially women, understand that ultrarunning is for everyone and can be a gateway to a fuller life – it’s not about being the best, it’s about being your best.”

In July 2015, Rebecca set off on an 11,000km (6,835-mile), year-long solo cycle ride from London to Tehran, through Europe and, among other places, Turkey, Lebanon and Iran, a revelatory journey documented in her new book. “I went to find the Middle East that lay beyond the bombs and burqas of the headlines,” she says, “to explore the historic, political and cultural connections between the region and the west.
“I learned the Middle East is predominantly a warm, sympathetic place, with a generous spirit and pockets of fierce beauty. And the area outside your comfort zone is never as frightening or risky as it appears.” Rebecc a’s book about cycling across the Middle East, The Slow Road To Tehran , is out this month , @reo_lowe
Sally is well respected in the surfing world for her inclusive approach. Based in Tynemouth, north-east England, she runs Yonder, a surf school, coaching company and surf brand that is helping to empower a community of surfing women in a region where the scene was slow to develop. A background working with the Red Cross and asylum seekers has perhaps informed her nurturing sensibility. Kicking back against the stereotypical portrayal of female surfers to “change the narrative of female surfing in the UK” is another aim. Listen to her interview on the excellent Looking Sideways action sports podcast; @sallymcgeesurf , surfyonder.com
Ali’s blogs and Instagram posts about her outdoorsy life in the Lakes are pure joy – all silly leaps into frozen lakes in her bobble hat, big grins on mountaintops and pints in cosy Cumbrian pubs. There are also useful local tips, and hats off to her for making her wild swimming groups pick up litter after their dips.
Ali prides herself on being honest and real, and her unpolished images of a normal woman having fun in the countryside are a refreshing change from the touched-up, bikini-clad perfection often found in the online travel sphere.
“I’ve had women contact me saying they’d never dared to be seen in public in a swimming costume before, but I’d encouraged them. I try not to polish too much; I’m a size 14 and ordinary. I just really love where I live and sharing that, along with a bit of sunshine and positivity.” girlabout.co.uk , @alwaysswimmingwild
“What really drives the work I do is spreading the joy of swimming and the joy of being outdoors with others,” says Omie, who was named Swim England’s Swimming Teacher of the Year 2021.
Omie is a host for Mental Health Swims in London, a free monthly swim meet focused on cold-water immersion, and director of Swimunity, a community interest group that teaches swimming to children and women for free in London. Her work involves getting women and children out of London and into nature, and increasing diversity in the water, enabling people to swim who might not otherwise have taken it up.
“It’s about so much more than just swimming up and down in a pool for hours. Getting outdoors and combining swimming with hikes, beautiful scenery and aquatic activities such as paddle boarding helps get this message across.” @swimunity , @omiedale
Rosie has numerous impressive journeys under her belt, from sailing solo across the Atlantic to running 20,000 miles across the globe, unsupported and carrying her belongings in a cart she towed behind her, after the death of her husband in 2002. She detailed this in her 2009 book Just a Little Run Around the World.
Her current mission, to run from the UK to Kathmandu to raise money for Phase Worldwide’s community charity work in Nepal, has been hindered somewhat not by her age, but by recent events. Setting out in 2018, she reached northern Turkey before the pandemic forced her to return home. Not one to be thwarted, she set off again via a 1,000-mile training run in the UK to Norway, planning to reach Kathmandu via Finland, Russia and China. Illness and the current situation with Russia have just brought her home again. But she won’t be here for long, and her next attempt will be live-blogged on her website. rosieswalepope.co.uk
Yes, there are countless professional female skiers posting about their unbelievable tricks and extreme lines on the world’s gnarliest mountains. But what we like about Sophie Nicholson, a skier, runner and sports therapist, is her get up and go attitude and humorous social media posts about her solo adventuring into the backcountry of Scotland’s Cairngorms, where she lives.
Running along remote ridges and Highland hikes as well as carrying her skis on her bike to reach untouched Scottish powder feature heavily, along with some painful injury shots.
“When I was younger I really wanted to be a boy as I loved doing things like skateboarding, playing football, and building forts. Back then, gender lines were very traditional and defined.
“As I’ve grown up I’ve continued to make choices that sit slightly out of the mainstream but these days I’m so so happy that I am a woman! The ladies who I am lucky enough to call my friends make my heart swell with pride – whether they have families or are blazing the single trail, all of these women are so inspiring to me – they are capable, resilient, adventurous, kind, brave and loyal.” @snicholson76
Although her most famous achievement was quite a while back – as a 27-year-old Tracy Edwards skippered the first all-female crew to sail in the 1989 around-the-world Whitbread race – it has been brought to the attention of a new generation thanks to the incredibly moving film about the feat, Maiden , being added to Netflix’s library in January. Tracy’s determination and skill in the face of sexism in the male-dominated yacht-racing world, and the power of the crew’s female friendships, will have you sobbing by the end, even if you’re a landlubber who gets seasick on canal boats.
Anna is a young but serious mountain woman, whose adventures climbing in the Scottish mountains – from the Cuillin of Skye and the Cairngorms to the wild seacliffs of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides are inspirational. Her progression over a decade of learning to climb on different rock across the UK is poetically described in her just-released debut book.
Anna says she was hugely inspired by Gwen Moffat, the first ever female mountain guide in the UK, and her book Space Below My Feet. “It gave me a real buzz to get out! Now aged 97 and still going strong, Gwen Moffat is an inspiring example.” Anna might just do the same for you.

Women still fear for their safety but are louder and more determined than ever
Where do women in the UK find themselves on International Women’s Day in 2022? In truth: more fearful about their safety, more anxious about their economic futures and wondering if the monumental gains made in gender equality over the last decades are at risk. But they are also louder and more determined than ever.
It is impossible to reflect on the last 12 months without focusing on the seismic revolution of understanding of male violence against women and girls (VAWG).
Research from Rosa , a grant-making charity for frontline women’s organisations, reveals that 89% of the 320 organisations they surveyed think public understanding of the problem has transformed since the murder of Sarah Everard one year ago.
The past year has also seen a rupturing of the trust between women and the state agencies that pledge to protect them. At a vigil to honour Everard in Clapham Common, which police had tried and failed to prevent by threatening to heavily fine organisers , women who had come to mourn were instead forcibly removed .
What trust was left took a further blow with the prosecution of two officers who shared pictures of the murdered sisters Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman, the exposure of vile sexist and racist Whatapp messages shared between officers based at London’s Charing Cross police station, and ongoing reports of officers accused of domestic abuse going unpunished, or worse uninvestigated.
Speaking to the Guardian on Monday, the new national police lead on VAWG, Maggie Blyth, promised change – a prioritisation of crimes against women and a crackdown on men within the ranks of the police who abuse their power. There is a moment of opportunity, she insisted, and it is too important to waste.
There is hope. At the grassroots level, councils like Greenwich, where Sabina Nessa was murdered, are helping fund plays about sexism and toxic masculinity , local youth rugby clubs are asking how they can help prevent violence against women , an outpouring of grief after the murder of Everard raised more than half a million pounds that will be distributed to small charities working at the vanguard of tackling misogyny and male violence.
On the national stage, the UK government and the mayors of London and Manchester have launched a communications campaign focusing on stopping perpetrators of sexual harassment and violence .
The government, the National Police Chiefs’ Council and the College of Policing have agreed to implement all the recommendations made by a damning inspection by the policing watchdog , leading to Blyth’s appointment and the upgrading of VAWG to the same strategic footing as terrorism.
The challenge now will be keeping the issue in the spotlight as the horror at what happened to Everard – exposed in the trial of her killer Wayne Couzens – moves further into the past.
More than a 125 women have died since International Women’s Day last year, according to the Femicide Census , which notes that a woman is killed by a man every three days.
The work of ending men’s violence towards women and girls will be arduous and painstaking. It is – as many who have worked in the sector for decades can attest – the work of a lifetime.
But, for now at least, the wail of anger and anguish that crescendoed after the murder of Everard continues to echo through society. Women have found their voice, and they are determined to be heard.

==================================================

International Women’s Day is blind to the greatest threat to women – Australia’s welfare system
International Women’s Day is upon us, and along with it the endless gabfests about women’s equality, mostly led and attended by women in suits.
Increasingly we’re seeing women’s safety feature in the discussion and cursory mentions of issues facing Blak, disabled and queer women.
But in 2022 the conversation about women’s equality and safety is still lacking the voices of people in the worst circumstances and those at highest risk of harm.
In the lead-up to IWD, a slick new campaign with the tagline #SafetyRespectEquity has been launched to near universal praise.
There’s no denying privileged women experience violent relationships. But, just as I feared, there was a glaring gap, a major threat to women’s safety that didn’t even rate a cursory mention in the campaign: poverty.
The welfare system is deeply imbued with misogyny. In my work as an anti-poverty activist I hear far too many examples of how it traps women in unsafe situations, whether in the workplace, the family home or a relationship. It disproportionately harms Blak, trans and disabled people. I agree with other advocates who say it’s harmful by design .
We see the results in the stomach-churning statistics. Chronic underinvestment in public housing and social security payments as low as half the poverty line means in a year 7,700 women return to their abuser due to risk of homelessness and 9,000 survivors who leave for good end up homeless.
And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.
Ninety per cent of women with intellectual disability have experienced sexual abuse . I am told stories by women who weren’t able to escape this abuse because the “safety net” failed them. According to Anti-Poverty Week* women aged 21-28 years in financial hardship were more than three times as likely to report severe partner abuse in a year. In 2019 more than 60,000 women aged 15-24 years who experienced violence also experienced moderate to very high levels of financial hardship.
There are myriad reasons women are excluded from accessing support altogether.
As my colleague Jay Coonan wrote recently , the partner income test is rooted in sexism and is a paternalistic hangover from a period when women were viewed only through the prism of their relationship to men.
The rule reduces or cuts people off if Centrelink deems someone to be in a relationship, regardless of whether finances are shared. It’s been retained only to save the government money, at great cost to women who are forced into financial dependence – itself a contributor to the strain that can lead to relationship breakdown.
Women living in Australia on the wrong visa type have no entitlement to an income support payment at all. And once you become a citizen, you are still excluded from payments such as the disability support pension – good luck to anyone who needs it within 10 years of moving here.
When people who are forced to comply with punitive “mutual” obligations face sexual harassment and assault because of these activities, they are trapped. Leaving means losing your poverty payment.
Women incur social security debts as a direct result of the actions of their abuser. They have payments wrongly cut off at an extraordinary rate, punishing both women and their children.
And then there’s the most abusive and insidious policy: cashless welfare programs like the cashless debit card that control women’s income and restrict their ability to survive in poverty.
It’s a racist program with its origins in the Howard government’s Northern Territory intervention and ever since it has targeted and punished First Nations women. Dr Elise Klein found that the CDC has not only failed to reduce violence, as the government says it’s designed to do, but there has been an increase in violence after its introduction.
Of course, it goes without saying setting every income support payment at a poverty level causes direct harm. The most common payment, jobseeker, is just half the Henderson poverty line.
The government’s national action plan to reduce violence against women and their children is completely silent on financial abuse. They refuse to even mention “social security” in the strategy to address family and domestic violence, while the National Council of Single Mothers and their Children says the welfare system is replicating the hallmarks of family and domestic violence.
If this isn’t violence against women, what is?
Advocates for women in poverty have put forward many proposals to address these harrowing statistics. We don’t need a special payment or special rules for people fleeing violent relationships. Targeted programs in effect act as a means test for people who are able to “prove” their circumstances to Centrelink – itself a traumatising process.
Any such program will inevitably exclude many people experiencing or at risk of violence, particularly trans and disabled people trapped in unsafe environments because they don’t have the money to escape.
The answer to ameliorating the disproportionate harm caused to women by the welfare system is a universal response that protects all women and trans folks by equipping us with access to enough resources to keep ourselves safe.
We need more money but that’s not all.
Raising all payments to above the Henderson poverty line while we do the work of developing a more sophisticated measure of poverty is a first step only and will not go far enough. It must be easier and faster to access welfare payments.
Everyone living in Australia must be able to access them, regardless of visa status. People cannot be forced from one abusive situation to another – removing dangerous and punitive measure like ‘mutual’ obligations requirements and cashless welfare must be a priority.
My friend Elly Baxter puts it simply : “The fact that mainstream feminism routinely ignores marginalised women is the reason we have been so stunted in our progress.”
As an anti-poverty activist it’s clear to me that the design of the welfare system – its inadequacy, who it excludes and how it operates – is undeniably the top reason women are unsafe. It hurts us whether we’re desperately trying to avoid it, desperately trying to escape it, or see no way out of it.
There is no pathway to safety, respect and equity for all women without a robust social safety net to protect those who are most disadvantaged.
It’s time corporate feminism grappled with it and realised that the movement for women’s safety must not just include but be led by Blak, disabled, trans and people who rely on the welfare system to live.

Police must call out sexism in force, says chief taking on violence against women
Policing attracts some men who want “to exert and coerce” vulnerable people, the new national police lead on violence against women has admitted, as she urged officers to create a “call-out culture” to tackle sexist and misogynistic behaviour.
Deputy chief constable Maggie Blyth, who took up the post of national lead for violence against women and girls (VAWG) at the National Police Chiefs’ Council five months ago, said it was wrong to dismiss abusive, violent or sexist officers as a “few bad apples”.
She added that policing scandals of the past 12 months, including the rape and murder of Sarah Everard by a serving police officer, had been a “stark check”.
“That was so shocking to policing that it rocked the whole of the service in a way that we really hadn’t seen since the murder of Stephen Lawrence,” said Blyth in an interview with the Guardian to mark International Women’s Day on Tuesday. “It felt, and continues to feel, like a watershed moment.”
Asked whether recent scandals such as revelations of deeply sexist and racist WhatsApp messages from officers demonstrated that the police were institutionally misogynistic, Blyth said policing reflected the “misogyny and sexism problem” found in society.
But she added that policing, like other jobs with access to power, could attract people who wanted to “use their power in a corrupt and criminal way”.
“There will be some attracted into working in policing, because of the powers that it offers them, the powers to exert and coerce other people, particularly vulnerable individuals. I think we shouldn’t be naive to that,” she said.
While proper vetting of officers was vital, it could only provide a “spotlight for a moment” on a potential recruit’s conduct, she said. Fellow officers had to be “upstanders, not bystanders” and feel supported and obliged to take action if they witnessed unacceptable behaviour.
Blyth acknowledged that scandals including the jailing of two Met officers for taking pictures of the dead bodies of two sisters had a “significant” impact on women’s trust and confidence in the police.
“As much as we are going after dangerous men in society and prioritising VAWG, we are going after dangerous men in policing,” she said.
But she insisted that an increasingly vocal and confident majority of officers wanted to change discriminatory cultures – adding that 42% of new recruits were now women, a record level, while 11.8% were from minority ethnic backgrounds.
“I see a workforce really angry and upset at the misogynist, racist, disrespectful behaviours of some of their colleagues and I see officers really wanting to demonstrate how different they are,” she said.
But Blyth is aware that she is not the first police leader to promise that lessons have been learned, and police culture is changing. She expects more scandals to emerge, adding that the public perception of policing of violence against women is likely to get worse before it gets better as whistleblowers expose digital evidence of misconduct.
“It isn’t helpful to say that these are isolated cases, we now know and we can see that they’re not,” she said. “My view is we have to be very clear that we are going to see more of these cases come to light.”
Real tangible progress was being made, she insisted, pointing to Operation Soteria – a pilot study to be introduced in 14 forces which focuses on a more aggressive pursuit of sexual predators rather than on the credibility of victims – and the recent announcement that VAWG will be given the same importance as counter-terrorism and serious organised crime as a strategic policing requirement .
But Blyth stressed that despite a change in narrative and focus, policing alone could not change the way that women and girls were treated, and called for societal change, including more education of boys and for more men to speak out against everyday sexism.
“I have optimism,” she said, “I wouldn’t do the job if I didn’t. But we need to really grasp this moment to make those changes, not let anyone off the hook, and not to move on to the next thing. Women’s lives mean more than that.”

Rev Richard Bradshaw’s Nigerian parishioner might be right about church leaders not praying for peace in Nigeria ( Letters, 4 March ), but I can assure both of them that at Holy Trinity Knaresborough, at various times in the past 20 years, we have prayed for peace in Nigeria, Angola, Libya, Somalia, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Syria, Myanmar, Iraq and Sri Lanka. I suspect that this also holds true for hundreds of parishes throughout the country. Ken Gambles Knaresborough, North Yorkshire
Helen White says: “In my house the only things in the fruit bowl are bananas” ( How to stop wasting food and save money, 7 March ). It sounds to me that she too has bought into the myth that you cannot keep bananas in the fridge. If green when bought, wait until they are the level of ripeness that you like, then refrigerate. I have been doing this for years – they last much longer and with no ill effects. Pete Lavender Nottingham

Much has been said about how slow the UK is in freezing or seizing Russian oligarchs’ assets compared with the EU ( Report, 3 March ). To be fair, critics are not taking into account the extra steps that our government has to take, ie checking how much the oligarchs have donated to the Tory party before deciding who to target.

Next stop, Sylvia Plath! Why it is time to redraw the London Underground map
W hen I was a baby feminist, I would argue with friends that public space was political. I had been radicalised by my teenage years, sick to the back teeth of street harassment from men who seemed to think that the streets were theirs to roam freely, while women were relegated to decoration. It wasn’t a regular occurrence, but it happened enough times to enrage me. Walking home from school in London , in uniform, I had been followed, had my arm snatched and had been approached at least once by a man who displayed stalking tendencies. As I grew older, I understood these actions as displays of dominance and I was disgusted. Alongside my indignation, I was crushingly disappointed. I had been raised in this city and hated that this kind of behaviour was an impediment to my teenage desire for autonomy and freedom.
I had been navigating public transport by myself for years at that point, and it took me everywhere I wanted to go. Once I had exhausted my immediate surroundings on foot, I’d take the Piccadilly line to gigs at the now bulldozed Astoria on Charing Cross Road. I’d jump on the Hammersmith and City line, a portal to dancing all day at Notting Hill carnival. The Circle line made me feel like an intellectual in the museums of South Kensington. There was no option back then to outsource travel plans to a clever little app, so in order to go anywhere I, like everyone else, would have to study the tube map to find out how to get to my destination. If I was feeling brave, I’d sometimes jump on the tube at Turnpike Lane and work it out as I went along, peering at the mini maps inside the train carriage and looming awkwardly over whoever was sitting in the seat beneath. I didn’t need a car. The map in my pocket opened up my city.
Wonder, exploration, ownership, reclaiming – these are all feelings I hoped to replicate when Emma Watson approached me to be a part of a project reimagining Transport for London’s iconic underground map. Alongside the American author Rebecca Solnit , we have replaced every name of a station with the name of a woman. A few years ago, Watson had been in conversation with Solnit, who had recently completed a book with the geographer Joshua Jelly-Schapiro. Nonstop Metropolis: A New York City Atlas is a book of essays highlighting stories of the city, complemented by 26 maps. One of the maps is a replica of the Metropolitan Transport Authority’s map of the New York City Subway. Every single one of the MTA’s 472 subway stations has had its original name replaced with the name of a woman or a women-led collective. The names were contemporary and historic, including people from the entertainment industry, writers, artists, agitators for women’s rights and a former first lady of the United States. Instead of subway stops named Penn Station, Bleecker Street and Grand Central, there was a station named after the Pulitzer prize-winning architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable, a station named after the musician Grace Jones, and a station named after the much-venerated black lesbian poet Audre Lorde.
In her conversation with Solnit, Watson had expressed her admiration of this feminist version of the New York subway map, and Solnit had immediately suggested that they create a London version.
The tube map has been reimagined many times before. Simon Patterson’s 1992 lithograph The Great Bear is the most well known. In this work, tube stations are named after famous people including religious figures, footballers and philosophers. A 2006 version of the tube map, published by the Guardian, endeavoured to illustrate the links between different British musicians and musical genres.
Turner prize-winning artist Lubaina Himid’s 2011 work Moments and Connections echoed the tube map, too. A retrospective map of three key exhibitions she curated in the 1980s that brought black and Asian British female artists from the margins to the centre, an artery-like line cuts through the middle, naming almost all of the artists she exhibited. Their names are intersected by tube lines highlighting the creative groups, learning institutions, exhibitions and publications that have been key to Britain’s black art movement. The map was created prior to Himid’s 2012 Thin Black Line(s) exhibition at Tate Britain. More recently, in 2017, the art collective Thick/er Black Lines released a version of the map, titled We Apologise For the Delay to Your Journey, highlighting unsung black British women and femmes of the art world. And in 2021, Transport for London, alongside the Black Cultural Archives, released a black history tube map, putting front and centre the historic contributions of black Londoners to the city. Everyone who remakes the map knows in their bones that there is power in a name.
So many different maps, signposting so much brilliant work. Yet today’s official tube map has only three stops named after women. Seven Sisters station is named after the Hibbert sisters, who lived during the late 19th century and are known for each planting a tree in the area. The other two stations are named after Queen Victoria (the obvious – Victoria station; but Lancaster Gate is also named after one of her royal titles).
In fact, many of the London Underground’s station names honour landowners, or members of the monarchy. The average tube traveller might not know that Leicester Square was named after Robert Sidney, the second earl of Leicester, or that Latimer Road station was named after the wealthy merchant Edward Latymer. But each man’s legacy lives on in the naming. So many statues and placenames work to memorialise the power of their day, signalling that the general public should concern themselves with deference towards those who accumulate capital or own land.
The City of Women London map centres different values. This map celebrates women and non-binary people with deep ties to the city. These are people who have achieved extraordinary things in their field, scaled new heights or served as the nucleus of social movements. We’ve tried our hardest to place each woman or non-binary person at a station that has relevance to their lives, whether it be that they lived, grew up, organised or worked in the area.
Some of our stations are named after wealthy people, but they aren’t on the map simply because of what they owned. Some are British, others were born overseas. On this map are people who have stretched the possibilities of what a woman could be. Among them are Claudia Jones, the journalist, black feminist and one of the founders of the Notting Hill carnival, and the fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, whose clothes made an indelible mark on London via the legacy of its punk scene.
Some of our tube stops celebrate collectives, instead of individuals. Their names represent historic sites of women-led protest. We’ve placed two black feminist organisations – Awaz, the UK Asian women’s collective; and Owaad, the Organisation of Women of African and Asian Descent – at Heathrow Terminals 2 & 3. In 1979, they organised a picket at Heathrow to protest against the British government’s invasive virginity testing of migrant women arriving in the country.
At the opposite end of the map, there was for us no other option for Bow Road than the match girls. Another powerful women’s collective, operating almost 100 years earlier in London’s East End, the 1,400 working-class women and girls working in Bryant & May’s match factory in Bow went on strike, and changed the course of Britain’s labour movement.
Our map also commemorates sites of tragedy. Victoria station is renamed after the transport worker Belly Mujinga , who died of Covid-19 complications during the first UK-wide lockdown.
The now closed Holloway women’s prison also takes a space on the map. It’s a place where feminist activists have long been imprisoned for their political action, from suffragists in the early 20th century, to the women of Greenham Common peace camp in the 80s. The feminist direct-action group Sisters Uncut occupied the visitor centre in 2017, writing in the Guardian that : “Prisons are an inhumane response to the social problems faced by vulnerable women.” One of those vulnerable women was Sarah Reed , a young black woman with a history of mental health problems, who in 2016 was found dead in her cell after being denied appropriate medical care. Just four years before, she faced an incident of shocking brutality also at the hands of the state: she had been attacked by a Metropolitan police officer who had accused her of shoplifting. The police officer was later convicted of common assault for the attack. In marking these tragedies, we aim to commemorate people who have been failed by our society, as well as those who have defied the odds.
London has long been a site of protest, common cause, collectivism and collaboration. It’s a city where decadence and extreme poverty live cheek by jowl. It’s a place where women from all over the world have moved in order to unfurl into their truest selves, often in collaboration with one another. This map might not change the world, but I hope it prompts you to take a second glance at places you might once have taken for granted, to imagine the lives lived by the women before you, and to think of the possibilities of what you might create. This map is a counter to any assertion that the city isn’t for us.

Companies with female leaders outperform those dominated by men, data shows
Women should play a central role in the UK’s post-pandemic economic recovery, with evidence revealing companies with more female leaders outperform those dominated by men, according to House of Commons research.
Accusing the government of ignoring women’s needs during the coronavirus pandemic and side-lining them in plans for recovery, the shadow secretary for women and equalities, Anneliese Dodds, said the data showed women held the key to a stronger economy, but they were being held back by a lack of investment and the risk of “childcare deserts” in parts of the country.
“When you’ve got more engagement from women, when women are in the driving seat to the extent they should be, it makes for far more successful businesses,” she said. “Our commitment is to consider women’s concerns and other equality issues from the start. The problem with the current government is they’re not even tacking women’s concerns on at the end, they’re not considering them at all.”
She warned that the UK was facing a “childcare emergency” with early years settings struggling to recruit staff and the Early Years Alliance reporting that some areas of England have seen a 25% decline in the number of places in the past six years.
“The childcare sector is facing a short-term emergency, seeing childcare deserts in different parts of the country, with providers going bust and not being able to continue operating – that has an awful impact on working women,” said Dodds. “Childcare providers are part of our economic infrastructure, we have to find a more sustainable way forward.”
To mark International Women’s Day, which is on Tuesday, Labour have collated data from the House of Commons library. It cited McKinsey research that shows companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on executive teams were 25% more likely to have above-average profitability than companies in the bottom, while companies with more than 30% female executives were more likely to outperform companies that don’t, according to research from academics from the Universities of Glasgow and Leicester .
But only eight women, and no women of colour, are currently employed as CEOs in the FSTE 100, while women hold only 14% of executive directorships and 38% of all directorships, according to the Fawcett Society’s Sex and Power report 2022 .
The data shows that women-led SMEs contribute about £85bn to economic output , but Beis research shows that only 16% of small business employers and one in three of entrepreneurs are women. There is further evidence that fewer women get access to financing and business loans, with only 15% of bank financing applications and 22% of new primary business bank accounts openings coming from women.
Dodds said Labour would create 100,000 government-backed start-ups with a “equal recovery pledge” ensuring female representation, strengthen the pay gap reporting system and give a “new deal” for working women.
“​​Unless we actually back women in business, then we’re going to be losing out on a huge amount of potential extra economic activity and prosperity, that all of our communities really need,” she said.
New global data from gender equity researcher Equileap, released for IWD, shows that in the UK, women make up only a fifth (20%) of executive team members, 13 companies (6%) have a female CEO, and 27 companies (13%) have a female CFO.
NatWest is the only company with both a female CEO and CFO. The analysis also found that the UK is one of the worst performing countries on flexible work options, with only 29% of companies publishing a flexible hours policy, and just 18% publishing a flexible locations policy.

==================================================

It took decades to achieve progress for women – why has it stalled?
T his Tuesday is International Women’s Day, when we celebrate women’s achievements and the victories women have won in the fight for equality. From the Equal Pay Act to the Sex Discrimination Act and the Equality Act through to the minimum wage and Sure Start , the Labour party has always stood up for women and driven the change they needed, while the Conservatives defended the status quo.
As Labour’s shadow chancellor of the exchequer, I know I stand on the shoulders of giants from our party’s past: the Labour women who stood up and changed our country for the better. Women like Barbara Castle, who introduced the Equal Pay Act; Jennie Lee, who created the Open University; Alice Bacon, who reformed the law to make abortions legal; Ellen Wilkinson, who raised the school-leaving age; Jo Richardson’s campaigning against domestic violence, and the work done on Sure Start and tax credits by Tessa Jowell and Harriet Harman, have all shaped our movement and our country.
Thanks to the radical improvements those Labour governments brought in to support women in their work and family lives, there are more women in work today than ever before, and more are balancing a career and a family, too.
This week we celebrate that progress, while acknowledging that there is still much to do before women and men are equal. In that context, there can be no shying away from the fact that women were disproportionately affected by the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Even before the pandemic hit, women were more likely to be stuck in low-paid work and hampered by a parenthood pay gap. At its height, they were more likely to be furloughed , more likely to lose income, and more likely to work in the sectors that were hardest hit. Black, Asian and minority ethnic women – who are more likely to be in lower paid , insecure work in the first place – were hit particularly hard. Working from home also increased family duties for women, with mothers more likely to be interrupted and finding themselves with less time than fathers for their paid job. And of course, women are still paid less than men – a gender pay gap that has actually widened over the last year.
The burden that women carried during the Covid crisis should be a wake-up call for the Conservative government. For too long, ministers have been complacent about the vital role that women can play in the economy. Labour wants to do things differently, with an approach based on bringing people together in a national endeavour, and on understanding that Britain’s real wealth is found in the effort and talent of tens of millions of working women.
Labour believes that women hold the key to a strong economy – and the evidence backs that up. Women-led small- and medium-sized enterprises contribute about £85bn to the economy. And when women are involved in businesses – whether starting up, rising up or sitting on boards– they make them more profitable. Companies with the most gender-diverse executive teams are 25% more likely to have above-average profitability than those with the least diverse teams, and companies where more than three in 10 of their executives are women are more likely to outperform companies than those with fewer female executives. The government’s own study of UK FTSE 100 firms found a positive relationship between gender diversity and firm performance, which became more significant when three or more women were appointed to the board.
This is all very encouraging, but it’s not clear if ministers have got the message. The government must recognise the role women will play in our economic recovery and understand the need to back them to succeed. Yet its own Small Business Survey shows that only 16% of small business employers and one in three of entrepreneurs are women , and women also struggle to access the financing and new business loans needed to get their companies off the ground. In bank financing, 15% of applications were led by women and 56% by men, and just 22% of new primary business bank accounts were opened by women, compared with 66% by men. Though success rates for both were roughly the same, the average loan amount approved for female-led businesses was around £25,000; for male-led businesses it was about £33,000.
Labour wants to put women at the heart of our economic recovery – to lift women up, not hold them back. We will do that by backing female entrepreneurs and great British enterprise. Under the Conservatives, the rate of business creation has plummeted across every English region since 2016. Labour would reverse that trend by creating 100,000 new startups in the first term of a Labour government across all English regions – doubling the number of businesses the government’s Start Up Loans scheme is delivering through a five-year funding guarantee that will fund 20,000 new businesses a year over the next five years.
Our Equal Recovery Pledge will also ensure that the inequality supercharged by the Covid pandemic does not become even deeper and more embedded during our recovery. The next Labour government will introduce a new deal for working people that will bring in stronger family-friendly rights.
On International Women’s Day, it’s right that we celebrate women and the progress they have made in building a more equal society. But we cannot be complacent about the challenges they still face today. Labour understands that women are crucial to the future of Britain’s economy – and, as the first woman chancellor under a Labour government, I am determined to make sure their effort and talent is recognised.

Belfast researcher wins £50,000 prize to aid early detection of ovarian cancer
About 20 women a day are diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the UK. Their condition is often well advanced before it is detected, making their tumours difficult to treat.
But if Belfast researcher Shannon Beattie is successful, it may be possible in the near future to make detections of ovarian cancer much more speedily and more accurately than today.
“Earlier detection of ovarian cancer would make a crucial difference in treating the disease,” said Beattie, the chief operating officer of GenoME Diagnostics , a spin-out company from Queen’s University Belfast. “It would allow doctors to treat tumours when they are small and have not spread to other parts of the body. That makes it much easier to eradicate them.”
And the project is about to be boosted with a £50,000 award that is to be given to Beattie as part of the celebrations marking International Women’s Day on Tuesday. She is one of 39 British female entrepreneurs who have won Innovate UK’s Women in Innovation awards, which will be announced on that date.
GenoME Diagnostics’ project has involved isolating a number of biomarkers that can potentially be detected in a patient’s blood. If a woman is found to be carrying a particular set of these biomarkers, this could indicate if she is in the early stages of ovarian cancer, said Beattie.
“At present, most cases of ovarian cancer are not spotted until a woman has reached the later stages of the disease. In stage three, there is roughly a 20% chance of survival, while for stage four, it is even less. So there is clearly an urgent need to develop more effective tests.”
The system being developed by Beattie and her colleagues at GenoME Diagnostics is focused on detecting one of the worst, most aggressive subtypes of ovarian cancer, a condition known as high-grade serous carcinoma, which accounts for about 70% of cases.
Armed with the biomarkers that have been identified and patented by her company, Beattie and her team are now analysing how effective these are at detecting – in early stages – those affected by high-grade serous carcinoma. Once this has been established, the aim will then be to find out if these biomarkers – which can be pinpointed using a simple blood test, it is hoped – are effective in detecting all ovarian cancers at early stages.
“It is not just early detection that we are developing,” Beattie added. “Current tests also trigger many false positives and that causes a lot of stress for women who are told, incorrectly, that they may have ovarian cancer, only to discover much later that they are actually unaffected by the condition.”
Other projects to be given prizes this week at the Women in Innovation awards will include a type of brain implant that can treat glioblastoma, the most common form of primary brain cancer in adults; a revolutionary wearable technology for athletes that provides key data to help reduce injuries and improve recovery times; and a scheme to make artificial leather from garden waste.
The 39 female entrepreneurs, who come from all nations and regions of the UK, will each be awarded £50,000 to help them scale up their ideas and get them into production.
The awards are now in their fourth year and are open to female founders, co-founders or senior decision-makers working in businesses that have been operating for at least a year.

Groundbreaking female composer’s lost madrigals to be heard for first time in 400 years
Sixteenth-century madrigals written by an Italian Renaissance female composer are to be performed for the first time in 400 years after the discovery of missing parts of the original music.
Maddalena Casulana became the first female composer to publish her own music at a time when such creativity was far from encouraged in women. She believed that men were making a “futile error” in assuming that women could not compose as well as they could and she brought out three books of madrigals under her name between 1568 and 1583, although only one of those collections has survived complete.
Now a further 17 madrigals have been added to her small surviving repertoire and 12 of those will be premiered on 8 March as part of BBC Radio 3’s special programming for International Women’s Day .
In what is seen as one of the most important musicological discoveries of recent years, Laurie Stras, professor of music at the universities of Southampton and Huddersfield, has tracked down the lost alto partbook of Casulana’s 1583 book of five-voice madrigals, with such evocative titles as Breeze that Murmurs in the Woods.
Vocal or instrumental polyphonic music was handwritten or printed in the 15th and 16th centuries in partbooks, with each part appearing separately.
Stras said that Casulana’s madrigals could not have been performed without the missing parts: “It would be like performing a string quintet without the second violin. It wouldn’t have made sense. I’ve been able to complete it. The jigsaw puzzle has slotted into place.”
She tracked down missing parts from the printed edition to the Russian State Library in Moscow, piecing together the music through other fragments in the Gdańsk Library of the Polish Academy of Sciences. It was from that Polish archive that the missing parts had disappeared in the second world war. They were presumably looted. They still bear Gdańsk’s catalogue numbers.
Stras said: “The reason that these madrigals are really important is that Casulana was acknowledged by her male contemporaries as a wonderful composer. She would have had to have been. We talk about women today having to be twice as good as men. That’s exactly what it was like then. These five-voice madrigals show us why she was such an extraordinary composer and why her contemporaries thought so highly of her. She is on the cutting-edge of composition in the 16th century. She uses really interesting harmonic effects.
“What we will get from hearing these madrigals is a sense of what’s considered really top-quality composition in her lifetime. She’s as good as any of the masters of her day. The closest comparison is Monteverdi’s teacher, Marc’Antonio Ingegneri, a composer of church music and madrigals.”
Casulana, who was also a lutenist and singer, was only too aware that, as a female composer, her music would be judged inferior to works created by her male counterparts.
Her 1568 book of madrigals bears an extraordinary dedication to her illustrious patron, Isabella de’ Medici Orsini, daughter of Cosimo I de’ Medici and an amateur musician.
She wrote: “These first fruits of mine, flawed as they are … show the world the futile error of men, who believe themselves patrons of the high gifts of intellect, which according to them cannot also be held in the same way by women.”
But her male contemporaries recognised her talent. One called her the “muse and siren of our age”. Another described her music, performed at the wedding of Wilhelm V of Bavaria, as “most beautiful”.
Noting that little is known about Casulana, who is thought to have died in 1590, Stras said: “How did she get to be so good? Where did she get that knowledge and that skill, because you’re not just born with being able to write five-voice polyphony. It’s really hard.”

St Pancras station to become an opera hall for International Women’s Day
C ommuters and long-haul travellers at London’s St Pancras International station will be offered something different this International Women’s Day: the chance to pause, reflect and enjoy a moment of art and connection in an unlikely place.
On 8 March the station will become a stage for a series of brand-new, train-themed micro-operas created by teams of female composers and librettists.
These include Laura Reid and Oge Nwosu’s poetic song Detritus, which will be performed at the National Rail service departure boards and is told through the eyes of a cleaner who reunites people with their lost items.
And against the backdrop of the station’s iconic statue The Meeting Place, Sarah Lianne Lewis and Sophia Chapadjiev’s The Parting Place will tell the tale of an elusive voyeur, while Joanna Taylor and Kerry Priest’s I Just Wanna Be (in Center Parcs) will explore journeys beyond the every day.
Each newly commissioned piece has been built on anecdotes submitted to the Royal Opera House by members of the public, exploring themes of time, motion, meetings and farewells. The female composer and librettist duos were selected after an open call from the ROH’s Jette Parker Young Artists Programme (JPYA).
The series, called Lost and Found, also includes Victoria Bernath and Teresa Howard’s Mini Break, a comic opera about the panic of lost passports and the inevitable bickering that follows, as well as Anna Braithwaite and Priests’ The Hardest Journey, about hidden disabilities.
The event is part of the Europalia Arts Festival, which involves European railway stations including Antwerp, Brussels and Rotterdam central stations.
Some of the writing teams were mentored by the award-winning composer Laura Bowler, whose new work The Blue Woman will premiere at the ROH this summer.
Singers include the Jette Parker Young artists April Koyejo-Audiger, Thando Mjandana, Chuma Sijeqa, Blaise Malaba and Egor Zhuravskii, joined by Siân Dicker, Milly Forrest, Njabulo Madlala, Sam Marston, Zahid Siddiqui and Jamie Woollard. Accompanying them will be players from the Belgium chamber ensemble Casco Phil, whose artistic director Benjamin Haemhouts devised the project.
Angelique MacDonald, producer for the JPYA, said: “It has been a privilege to read the personal stories that were shared with us for this project, and watch them inspire seven new works in different styles and approaches. Opera is an innately human art form and it’s hugely exciting to be able to perform such relatable work with Caso Phil at St Pancras International.”
Wendy Spinks, commercial director at HS1, said: “We are so excited for St Pancras International to be the backdrop for the latest Lost and Found performances, straight off the Eurostar. There will no doubt be many interesting and entertaining stories from travellers who pass through train stations, and we can’t wait to see them brought to life through the magic and beauty of opera.”
This article was amended on 20 February 2022 because an earlier version misspelled Victoria Bernath’s surname as “Bernarth”.
