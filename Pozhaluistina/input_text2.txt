Elton John 
Can you feel the love tonight
There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you




And can you feel the love tonight? (Tonight)
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? (Tonight)
How it's laid to rest?
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best




There's a time for everyone, if they only learn
That the twistin' kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours




And can you feel the love tonight? (Tonight)
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? (Tonight)
How it's laid to rest?
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best


It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

THe most beautiful girl in the world
Could you be
The most beautiful girl in the world?
It's plain to see
You're the reason that God made a girl




When the day turns into
The last day of all time
I can say I hope you are in
These arms of mine
And when the night falls before that day
I will cry, I will cry
Tears of joy, 'cause after you
All one can do is die, oh

Baby, i love your way
Ooh, baby, I love your way, every day, yeah-eeh-yeah
Ooh, baby, I love your way, every day




Shadows grew so long before my eyes
And they're moving across the page
Suddenly the day turns into night (Ooh)
Far away from the city




But don't, oh no, hesitate
'Cause your love just won't wait, hey-eeh-yeah-yeah




Ooh, baby, I love your way, every day, yeah-eeh-yeah
I wanna tell you I love your way, every day, yeah-yeah
I wanna be with you night and day




The moon appears to shine and light the sky
With the help of some fireflies
I wonder how they have the power to shine, shine, shine
Well, I can see them under the pine




But don't, woah no no, hesitate, la-di-dah
'Cause your love just won't wait

Clouds are stalking islands in the sun

Warren G
Regulate
Regulators
We regulate any stealin' of his property
We're damn good too
But you can't be any geek off the street
You gotta be handy with the steel, if you know what I mean
Earn your keep
Regulators, mount up


It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets, tryin' to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some phones
Rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone


Just hit the Eastside of the LBC
On a mission, tryin' to find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213




So I hooks a left on 21 and Lewis
Some brothers shootin' dice, so I said, "Let's do this"
I jumped out the ride and said, "What's up?"
Some brothers pulled some gats, so I said, "I'm stuck"


Since these girls peepin' me, I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard, they straight hit the curb
Onto bigger, better things than some horny tricks
I see my homie and some suckers all in his mix




I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they takin' Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brothers, said, "Damn, what's next?"




They got my homie hemmed up and they all around
Can't none of them see him if they goin' straight pound-for-pound
They wanna come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down




They got guns to my head, I think I'm goin' down
I can't believe it's happenin' in my own town
If I had wings, I would fly, let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homie Nate




Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin', it's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate




I laid all them busters down, I let my gat explode
Now I'm switchin' my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts, sit back and observe
I just left a gang of hoes over there on the curb




Now, Nate got the freaks and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked, I was on the same track
Back up, back up 'cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me, the Warren to the G




Just like I thought, they were in the same spot, in need of some desperate help
But Nate Dogg and the G child were in need of somethin' else
One of them dames was sexy as hell, I said, "Ooh, I like your size"
She said, "My car's broke down and you seem real nice, would you let me ride?"
I got a car full of girls and it's goin' real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel








I'm tweaking into a whole new era
G-funk, step to this, I dare you
Funk on a whole new level
The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble
Chords, strings, we brings melody, G-funk
Where rhythm is life and life is rhythm


If you know like I know, you don't wanna step to this
It's the G-funk era, funked out with a gangster twist
If you smoke like I smoke, then you're high like every day
And if your ass is a buster, 213 will regulate
Jon Secada
If you go
Taking a day at a time
Dealing with feelings I don't wanna hide
Learning to love as I go, baby
Without taking you along for a ride




Tried to find myself
Tried to find the truth
Get out from this shell
Girl I'm almost there
To show you how much I really care




If you go, say goodbye
There'll be something missing in my life
'Cause you know
That all I really (all I really) want is you (is you, baby)




Sorry if you felt misled
But I know what I feel, I know what I said, baby
God I hope you believe, believe in all that we can be
The future in us together in love




You're the reason I'm strong (you're the reason)
Don't you think I don't know
This is where I belong
Give me the time
To say that you're mine, to say that you're mine


If you go, say goodbye
There'll be something missing in my life
'Cause you know
That all I really want is you (is you)
(All I really want)
If you go, say goodbye
There'll be something missing in my life
'Cause you know (cause you know)
That all I really want is you (is you)




Tried to find myself (Tried to find myself)
Tried to find the truth (Tried to find myself)
Get out from this shell
Girl I'm almost there
So let me show you, so let me show you




If you go, say goodbye
There'll be something missing in my life (in my life)
'Cause you know (baby)
That all I really want is you (is you)(baby yeah)


If you go, say goodbye (say goodbye)
There'll be something missing in my life (in my life)
'Cause you know (baby)
That all I really (all I really) want is you
All I really want
All I really want is you
All I really want is you
If you go, say goodbye
There'll be something missing in my life (in my life)
'Cause you know (baby)
That all I really want is you (is you)




Richard Marx
Now and Forever
Whenever I'm weary
From the battles that rage in my head
You make sense of madness
When my sanity hangs by a thread
I lose my way but still, you seem to understand
Now and forever, I will be your man




Sometimes, I just hold you
Too caught up in me to see
I'm holding a fortune
That Heaven has given to me
I'll try to show you each and every way I can
Now and forever, I will be your man




Now, I can rest my worries and always be sure
That I won't be alone anymore
If I'd only known you were there all the time
All this time




Until the day the ocean doesn't touch the sand
Now and forever, I will be your man
Now and forever, I will be your man

When can i see you
When can my heart beat again?
When does the pain ever end?
When do the tears stop from running over?
When does "you'll get over it" begin?




I hear what you're sayin'
But I swear that it's not making sense
So when can I see you




When can I see you again?
And when can my heart beat again?
When can I see you again?
And when can I breathe once again?
And when can I see you...




When does my someday begin?
When I'll find someone again?
And what if I still am not truly over
What am I supposed to do then, baby, baby?




Please hear what I'm sayin'
Even if, if it's not making sense
So when can I see you...


When can I see you again?
And when can my heart beat again?
When can I see you again, baby?
And when can I breathe once again?
And when can I see you again?




Yeah baby
Please hear what I'm sayin'
Even if, if it's not making sense, baby
So when can I see you again?




When can I see you again?
When can my heart beat again? Baby, yeah
When can I see you again, baby?
And when can I breathe once again?
And when can I see you again?




Again
I wanna see you again
Again

Please forgive me
Still feels like our first night together
Feels like the first kiss and it's gettin' better baby

The one thing I depend on
Is for us to stay strong
With every word and every breath I'm prayin'
That's why I'm sayin'




Please forgive me, I know not what I do
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you
Don't deny me this pain I'm going through
Please forgive me, if I need you like I do
Babe, believe me, every word I say is true
Please forgive me, if I can't stop loving you
Never leave me, I don't know what I do
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you


Can't stop loving you




one 4 all
so much in love
As we stroll along together
Holding hands walking all along
So in love are we two
That we don't know what to do
So in love (So in love)
In a world of our own (So in love)




And as we walk by the sea together
Under stars twinkling high above
So in love are we two
No one else but me and you
So in love (So in love)
So much in love (So in love)
So in love (So in love)
So much in love (So in love)




We stroll along together
I tell you I need you oh so much
I love, I love you, my darling
Can you tell it in my touch?




As we walk down the aisle together
We will vow to be together till we die
So in love are we two
Just can't wait to say, "I do"
So in love (So in love)
In a world of our own (So in love)
So in love (So in love)
Are you and I (So in love)
Baby, I hope you realize that you mean so much to me
You're everything I ever wanted in a woman
To touch you, to feel your body close to me
I just want to hold you in my arms forever
I love you, baby
(sung) Can you tell it in my touch




As we walk down the aisle together
We will vow to be together till we die
So in love are we two
Just can't wait to say, "I do"
So in love (So in love)
Are you and I (So in love)
So in love (so in love)
Are you and I (So in love)

Michael Bolton
Said loved you… but i lied
You are the candle, and love's the flame
A fire that burns through wind and rain
Shine your light on this heart of mine
'Til the end of time
You came to me like the dawn through the night
Just shinin' like the sun
Out of my dreams and into my life
You are the one, you are the one




Said I loved you, but I lied
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you, but I was wrong
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong
Said I loved you, but I lied




With all my soul, I've tried in vain
How can mere words this heart explain
This taste of heaven so deep, so true
I've found in you, oh yeah
So many reasons in so many ways
My life has just begun
I need you forever, well, I need you to stay
You are the one, you are the one




Said I loved you, but I lied
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you, but I was wrong
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong
Said I loved you, but I lied




You came to me like the dawn through the night
Just shinin', shinin' like the sun
Out of my dreams and into my life
You are the one, you are the one




Said I loved you, but I lied (Said I loved you, but I lied)
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside (Said I loved you, but I lied)
Said I loved you, but I was wrong (Said I loved you, but I'm wrong)
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong (Ooh)




Said I loved you (Said I loved you)
But this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you, but I lied




Tevin Campbell
Can we talk
Last night, I, I saw you standing
And I started, started pretending
That I knew you, and you knew me, too




And just like a Roni, you were too shy
But you weren't the only 'cause so was I
And I dreamed of you ever since
Now, I build up my confidence
Girl, next, next time you come my way
I'll know just what to say




Can we talk for a minute?
Girl, I want to know your name
Can we talk for a minute?
Girl, I want to know your name




I started to write you letters
But I wanted to be more clever
I wanted to get down and sweet talk you
Hey, baby




But just like a baby, I could not talk
And I tried to come closer, but could not walk
And I think of it every night
How I just could not get it right, oh
If we ever come close again
I'll know what I'll say then, yeah

Meat loaf
I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)
And I would do anything for love
I'd run right into hell and back
I would do anything for love
I'll never lie to you and that's a fact
But I'll never forget the way you feel right now
Oh no, no way
And I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that
Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that




And some days it don't come easy
And some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
And these are the days that never end
And some nights you're breathin' fire
And some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothin' I've ever
Seen before or will again


And maybe I'm crazy
Oh, it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me
No one else can save me now but you
As long as the planets are turnin'
As long as the stars are burnin'
As long as your dreams are comin' true
You better believe it




That I would do anything for love
And I'll be there till the final act
And I would do anything for love
And I'll take the vow and seal a pact
But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way
Tonight
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that




I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that






And some days I pray for silence
And some days I pray for soul
Some days I just pray to the God
Of Sex and Drums and Rock 'N' Roll
And some nights I lose the feelin'
And some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all
When I watch you dance and the thunder rolls




And maybe I'm lonely
That's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only
One and only promise I can keep
As long as the wheels are turnin'
As long as the fires are burnin'
As long as your prayers are comin' true
You better believe it




That I would do anything for love
And you know it's true and that's a fact
I would do anything for love
And there'll never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better than I do it with you
So long, so long
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, no, no, I won't do that


I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that




But I'll never stop dreamin' of you every night of my life
No way
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that




Will you raise me up? Will you help me down?
Will you help get me right out of this Godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?
I can do that
Oh, I can do that
Will you hold me sacred? Will you hold me tight?
Can you colorize my life? I'm so sick of black and white
Can you make it all a little less old?
I can do that
Oh, oh, now, I can do that
Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me somethin' I can take home?
Now, I can do that
Oh, oh, now, I can do that
Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
Will you hose me down with holy water if I get too hot?
Will you take me places I've never known?
Now, I can do that
Oh, oh, now, I can do that
After a while you'll forget everything
It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
And you'll see that it's time to move on
I won't do that
I won't do that
I know the territory I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later you'll be screwin' around
I won't do that
No, I won't do that




Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

Gangsta Lean
This song's dedicated to my homies in that gangsta lean
Why'd you have to go so soon?
It seems like yesterday, we were hangin 'round the hood
Now I'm gonna keep your memory alive like a homie should




A lifetime of memories going down the drain
I'd like to keep steppin', but I can't get past the pain
I tip my 40 to your memory
Take a drink, and I stop to think, and I
I know one day soon, we'll be-we'll be hangin' out




This is for my homies (This is for my homies, well, well)
See you when I get there (In that gangsta lean, in that gangsta lean)
This is for my homies (This is for my homies, well)
See you when I get there (In that gangsta lean, in that gangsta lean)




My God, my God
Could you pass on a message for me?
Tell him put down those dice for a second, Lord
Listen to his homie
Could you tell him I'll never let go of his memory?
So his son will know, he don't have to cry no more
Cause God's got his back, I said God's got his back




A lifetime of memories going down the drain
I'd like to keep steppin', but I can't get past the pain
I tip my 40 to your memory
Take a drink, and I stop to think, and I
I know one day soon, we'll be- We'll be hangin' out




This is for my homies (This is for my homies)
See you when I get there (In that gangsta lean, in that gangsta lean)
This is for my homies (This is for my homies)
You know I miss you, you know I miss you, my homie
See you when I get there (In that gangsta lean, in that gangsta lean)




This song is dedicated to homies in that gangsta lean
Tommy from Master's Touch
My boy Y-B, and my boy Eibere
And whoever else out there that's gotta homie thats in a gangsta lean
And also my boys in the pen that ain't ever gonna see the street again
Cause you know what?
It don't matter what they was doing, while they was here
They could've been bangin', slangin', but they ain't here no more
And thats somebody's daddy, that's somebody's baby, that's somebody's homie
So go on and let 'em rest while they in that gangsta lean
You know what I'm sayin'? That's on the real, loc
This is for my homies (I can't believe that you're gone)
See you when I get there (I'll see you, I'll see you, I'll see you, I'll see you)
This is for my homies (Now that your in that gangsta lean, well well well)
See you when I get there (I'm so sorry you're gone, but I've got to keep on)
This is for my homies (I gotta keep movin', I gotta keep movin)
I gotta keep movin', movin', movin', movin'
See you when I get there (I'll see you, I'll see you)
One day, someday, homie, someday
This is for my homies (This is for my homies, yeah-yeah)
See you when I get there


Us3 - Cantaloop (Flip Fantasia)
Ladies and gentlemen, as you know we have something special down here at Birdland this evening
A recording for Blue Note Records

Yeah...yeah...yeah
Funky, funky
How 'bout a big hand now
Wait--wait a minute




Groovy groovy jazzy funky pounce bounce dance as we
Dip in the melodic sea, the rhythm keeps flowin', and drips to MC
Sweet sugar pop sugar pop rocks it pop
Ya dont stop 'til the sweet beat drops
I show and prove as I stick and move
Vivid poems recited on top of the groove
Smooth, my, floating like a butterfly
Notes set afloat, sung like a lullaby
Brace yourself as the beat hits ya
Dip trip, flip fantasia




(Yeah...yeah...yeah...What's that?)
Itty bitty bop (Yeah)
Itty bitty bop (Funky, funky)


Feel the beat drop, jazz and hip hop
Drippin' in your dome, makes you zone and bop
Funk and fusion, a fly illusion
Keeps ya coastin' on the rhythm you're cruisin'
Up down, round and round, rhymes profound
But nevertheless ya gots to get down
Fantasy freak thru the beat so unique
Ya move your feet, the sweat from the heat
Back to the fact I'm the mack and I know that
The way I kick the rhymes, some would call me a poet
Poems steady flowin', growin', showin' sights and sound
Caught in the groove in Fantasia I'm found
Many trip the tour upon the rhymes they soar
To an infinite height to the realm of the hardcore
Here we go off I take ya
Dip trip, flip fantasia




(Yeah...yeah...yeah...What's that?)
Itty bitty bop (Yeah)
Itty bitty bop (Funky, funky)


(Yeah...yeah...yeah...What's that?)
(Yeah...yeah...yeah...Funky, funky)


Jump to the jam, boogie woogie jam slam
Bust the dialect, I'm the man in command
Come flow with the sounds of the mighty mic master
Rhyming on the mic, I'm bringing suckas their disaster
Beaucoup ducs but I still rock Nike
With the razzle dazzle, star I might be
Scribble drabble scrabble on the microphone I babble
As I flip the funky words, into a puzzle
Yes yes yes, on and on as I flex
Get with the flow, words manifest
Feel the vibe from here to Asia
Dip trip, flip fantasia
Out




Ya don't stop
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Gimme more
Of that funky horn

Beck - Loser
In the time of chimpanzees, I was a monkey
Butane in my veins, and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray paint the vegetables
Dog food skulls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the loveseat
Someone came, saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park
Yo, cut it




Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me? (Double barrel buckshot)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?




The forces of evil and a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with the phony gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey neck, and it's hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beat, for the body, for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax fallin' on a termite
Who's chokin' on the splinters




Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me? (Get crazy with the cheese whiz)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me? (Drive-by body pierce)




(Yo, bring it on down)
(em llik uoy t'nod yhw os
Ybab resol a m'I
Rodedrep nu yoS)
I'm a driver, I'm a winner
Things are gonna change, I can feel it




Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me? (I can't believe you)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me? (Uh)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me? (Uh, Sprechen Sie Deutsch, eh, baby?)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me? (Know what I'm sayin'?)




Gin Blossoms - Found Out About You
All last summer in case you don't recall
I was yours and you were mine; forget it all
Is there a line that I could write
That's sad enough to make you cry?
And all the lines you wrote to me were lies
Months roll past, the love that you struck dead
Did you love me only in my head?
There were things you said and did to me
They seem to come so easily
The love I thought I'd won, you give for free




Whispers at the bus stop
Well, I've heard about nights out in the schoolyard
I found out about you
I found out about you




Rumors follow everywhere you go
Like when you left and I was last to know
Well, you're famous now and there's no doubt
In all the places you hang out
They know your name and they know what you're about




Whispers at the bus stop
Well, I've heard about nights out in the schoolyard
I found out about you
I found out about you








Street lights blink on through the car window
I get the time too often on AM radio
Well, you know it's all I think about
I write your name, drive past your house
Your boyfriend's over, I watch your lights go out




Whispers at the bus stop
Well, I've heard about nights out in the schoolyard
I found out about you
I found out about you
Whispers at the bus stop
Well, I've heard about nights out in the schoolyard
I found out about you
I found out about you

Keep comin' up with funky-ass shit, like, every single day
May I kick a little something (Yeah)
For the Gs and make a few ends (Yeah)
As I breeze through? Two in the mornin'
And the party's still jumpin' 'cause my mama ain't home
I got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on, and
They ain't leavin' 'til six in the mornin' (Six in the mornin', six in the mornin')
So what you wanna do? Shit
I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But (But what?) we don't love them hoes (Yeah)
So we gon' smoke an ounce to this
Gs up, hoes down while you motherfuckers bounce to this


Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice
Laid back
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind




Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this type of shit happens all the time
You gotta get yours, but fool, I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drank to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the homeboy's lady (Oh, that bitch?)
Eighty degrees when I tell that bitch, "Please
Raise up off these N-U-Ts, 'cause you gets none of these"
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound
Feel the breeze biatch, I'm just
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice
Laid back
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice

Later on that day, my homie Dr. Dre
Came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic
That made me choke, shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin'
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me, not with a cherry on top
'Cause when I bust my nut, I'm raising up out the cot
Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you hoes, I'm out the door, and I'll be


Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice

'Cause you'll always be my friend (Come back to me, come back, I love you)
I will never lie again (I don't wanna lie)
'Cause a friend like you will last forever (A friend like you will last forever)
I will never lie again (La-dee-ah-yee-ah, la-dee-ah-yee-ah)
'Cause you'll always be my friend (You'll always be my friend)
I will never lie again (Don't wanna lie to you, girl)
'Cause a friend like you will last forever (A friend like you will last forever)
I will never lie again (La-dee-ah-yee-ah, la-dee-ah-yee-ah)

Saturday mornin' just gettin up
With a hangover smellin' like I fucked
I really can't remember cause I'm still kinda faded
So I close my eyes and thank God that I made it
Now I'm gettin flashbacks of some O.J
With a green glass, says Tanqueray
Took it to the head, gulped it down with the quickness
Now I need a bitch so I can handle my business
What do you know, a freak's in my reach
Threw her on the flo', stuck it in her deep
She's screamin and she's screamin and she's screamin, gettin hoarse
But then I busted a nut, and that was that
So kick the chorus






My homies are down, chillin' in the hood
But them hood bitches, well they ain't no good
To another man well she might be some good cat
But homies in the hood label her as a hood rat
She's scandalous
So those with game can fuck
And ooh, she'll clown your ass real fast, if you're quick to nut
And when you're in that thi-ing
She'll make a nigga si-ng
Duh-du-dway, duh-dum-dway, duh-dum-dway
But you don't hear me doe
Ain't nuthin wrong with being a Trojan man, when ya ridin
So let's kick the chorus please if ya like it








My homie's clownin' in his dope, yellow chevy
Too O.D.'ed to be dropped
Kenwood's kickin that funk in the trunk
Clean with the rag on top, yeah
Rollin down the 'Shaw, guess what we saw, some bitches
The finest one is on my nuts, she's blowing kisses
So I approached the freak of the week
And I played it like a game of blackjack
And for all that ass that she toted around
Well I offered a backpack
And since I'm a mack
Well you know how the story goes
So all ya hoes and their bros here we go

2Pac - Keep Ya Head Up
Little something for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corin


Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots (Oh)
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care (Oh)
And, uh, I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
'Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em (You don't need him)
You know what makes me unhappy? (What's that?)
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman (Yeah, yeah)
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
(Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?)
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't, we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies (Oh, yeah-yeah)
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up


(Keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
(Oh-oh, keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter




Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right (Oh, yeah-yeah)
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay your rent
And in the end, it seems I'm headin' for the pen'
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night, my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity (Oh, no, no, no)
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up, huh
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
Said it ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy, huh
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive 'cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up


(Keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
(Oh-oh, keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter


And, uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more (Oh-oh)
'Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain, you was dealt this hell of a hand
Without a man, feelin' helpless (I know you were)
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While the tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You're steady hopin' things don't all fall this week (Yeah)
'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it (Yeah)
And don't blame me, I was given this world, I didn't make it (Oh, yeah)
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends (Oh, yeah)
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up
But, huh, please, you got to keep your head up
