She left the piece open, revealing a sliver of her silky cream dress underneath, and grabbed her black leather Valentino bag for the evening.\",\n",

For this installment, the group was joined by a teenage streamer (played by the episode’s host, Stranger Things star Finn Wolfhard) and A$AP Rocky... played by A$AP Rocky. The Man’s Best Friend musician’s cameo marked her fourth time on SNL since her musical debut back in May 2024, and to celebrate, she hit the after party in style. Stepping out in New York City, Carpenter bundled up in a double-breasted Valentino Garavani coat, fashioned from black wool with an ankle-length silhouette and adorned with fur cuffs and a matching neckline for a cozy yet opulent feel.

В те дни далеко на Юге, у моря, жил бедный рыбак по имени Аршиш, а с ним мальчик по имени Шаста, звавший его отцом. Утром Аршиш выходил в море ловить рыбу, а днём запрягал осла, клал рыбу в повозку и ехал в ближайшую деревню торговать. Если он выручал много, он возвращался в добром духе и Шасту не трогал; если выручал мало, придирался, как только мог, и даже бил мальчика. Придраться было нетрудно, Шаста делал по дому всё – стирал и чинил сети, стряпал и убирал.\n",
        "Шаста никогда не думал о том, что лежит от них к Югу; он бывал с Аршишем в деревне, и ему там не нравилось. Он видел точно таких людей, как его отец, – в грязных длинных одеждах, сандалиях и тюрбанах, с грязными длинными бородами, медленно толковавших об очень скучных делах. Зато его живо занимало всё, что лежит к Северу; но туда его не пускали. Чиня на пороге сети, он с тоской глядел на Север, но видел только склон холма, небо и редких птиц.\n",
        "Когда Аршиш сидел дома, Шаста спрашивал: «Отец, что там, за холмом?» Если Аршиш сердился, он драл его за уши, если же был спокоен, отвечал: «Сын мой, не думай о пустом. Как сказал мудрец, прилежание – корень успеха, а те, кто задаёт пустые вопросы, ведут корабль глупости на рифы неудачи».\n",
        "Шасте казалось, что за холмом – какая-то дивная тайна, которую отец до поры скрывает от него. На самом же деле рыбак говорил так, ибо не знал, да и знать не хотел, какие земли лежат к Северу. У него был практ\n",

        "In those days, far south in Calormen on a little creek of the sea, there lived a poor fisherman called Arsheesh, and with him there lived a boy who called him Father. The boy’s name was Shasta. On most days Arsheesh went out in his boat to fish in the morning, and in the afternoon he harnessed his donkey to a cart and loaded the cart with fish and went a mile or so southward to the\n",

There was always something to find fault with for Shasta had plenty of work to do, mending and washing the nets, cooking the supper, and cleaning the cottage in which they both lived.\n",
        "Shasta was not at all interested in anything that lay south of his home because he had once or twice been to the village with Arsheesh and he knew that there was nothing very interesting there. In the village he only met other men who were just like his father—men with long, dirty robes, and wooden shoes turned up at the toe, and turbans on their heads, and beards, talking to one another very slowly about things that sounded dull.\n",
        "But he was very interested in everything that lay to the North because no one ever went that way and he was never allowed to go there himself. When he was sitting out of doors mending the nets, and all alone, he would often look eagerly to the North. One could see nothing but a grassy slope running up to a level ridge and beyond that the sky with perhaps a few birds in it.\"\"\"\n",

For this installment, the group was joined by a teenage streamer (played by the episode’s host, Stranger Things star Finn Wolfhard) and A$AP Rocky... played by A$AP Rocky. The Man’s Best Friend musician’s cameo marked her fourth time on SNL since her musical debut back in May 2024, and to celebrate, she hit the after party in style. Stepping out in New York City, Carpenter bundled up in a double-breasted Valentino Garavani coat, fashioned from black wool with an ankle-length silhouette and adorned with fur cuffs and a matching neckline for a cozy yet opulent feel. She left the piece open, revealing a sliver of her silky cream dress underneath, and grabbed her black leather Valentino bag for the evening.\n",
