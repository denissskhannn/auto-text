The New York Times reports that Tynesha McCarty-Wroten, who posts to TikTok under the name Tea Tyme, has been charged by the Zion Police Department with two felonies — reckless homicide and aggravated use of a communications device resulting in death. In a video that has been reshared by other accounts on TikTok, woman posting as Tea Tyme can reportedly be seen speaking into her phone when there’s a loud thud. An offscreen child asks, “What was that?” then the woman replies, “I hit somebody.” Surveillance videos reportedly showed McCarty-Wroten’s vehicle entering the intersection while the traffic light was still red, with investigators determining that she did not seem to slow down or change course before striking Darren Lucas, who was later pronounced dead at the hospital. McCarty-Wroten’s lawyer told the NYT that evidence will show that “what happened was an accident, was a negligent act, but was not an intentional or reckless act.”\n",

As first spotted by the Google Pixel Hub group on Telegram and subsequently reported in 9to5Google, a Hindi version of the Gmail support website states that Google is “gradually rolling out to all users” the ability to change the email address tied to their Google account, including changing from their current Gmail address to “to a new email address that ends in gmail.co m.” If you make the switch, your old Gmail address should still work as an alias, and you’ll be able to sign into Google services with either your new or old address. However, you won’t be able to create any additional Gmail addresses tied to your account for another 12 mont hs. As of Sunday afternoon, the English-language version of the support site still states, “If your account’s email address ends in @gmail.com, you usually can’t change it” and instead suggests changing the name associated with the address or signing up for a new address and then transferring emails and contacts over.\n",

            "Запрос: FaZe Clan’s future is uncertain after influencers depart Six influencers recently announced that they are leaving esports group FaZe Clan following unsuccessful contract negotiations with new management. Bloomberg reports that influencers known as Adapt, Jason, Ronaldo, Lacy, Rage, and Silky — the entire roster on the FaZe Clan website — all announced that they are leaving the group. Adapt wrote on X that he’d spent 14 years as part of FaZe Clan: “Over half of my life, I’d be lying if I said this didn’t hurt, but it had to be done.” Another FaZe Clan member who left in August had described the situation as one where the influencers felt they had “no control, and it’s like we’re puppets.” The influencers had reportedly been negotiating with Faze Clan investor HardScope and its CEO Matt Kalish for the past half year. Kalish plans to continue the group without the departed influencers. “My best guess is they’re all good kids and have a lot of people in their ear and are confused,” he told Bloomberg. He also claimed that the group’s current financial structure is “unsustainable.” FaZe Clan went public in 2022, but the company was acquired by GameSquare for $17 million the following year, and its CEO was fired.\n",

Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the targeted individuals as “radical activists and weaponized NGOs” who have “led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose.” While Ahmed was born in the United Kingdom, he has a U.S. green card, resides in the United States, and has an American wife and child. Ahmed defended his work in an interview with PBS News, describing the government’s move as “another example of these companies [such as Meta, OpenAI, and Elon Musk’s X] which have tried to evade responsibility using their big money to try and influence things in politics.” A lawsuit by X against the CCDH was dismissed last year, but an appeal is pending.\n",

            "Запрос: Nvidia to license AI chip challenger Groq’s tech and hire its CEO Nvidia has struck a non-exclusive licensing agreement with AI chip competitor Groq. As part of the deal, Nvidia will hire Groq founder Jonathan Ross, president Sunny Madra, and other employees. CNBC reported that Nvidia is acquiring assets from Groq for $20 billion; Nvidia told TechCrunch that this is not an acquisition of the company and did not comment on the scope of the deal. But if CNBC’s numbers are accurate, this purchase is expected to be Nvidia’s largest ever, and with Groq on its side, Nvidia is poised to become even more dominant in chip manufacturing. As tech companies compete to grow their AI capabilities, they need computing power, and Nvidia’s GPUs have emerged as the industry standard. But Groq has been working on a different type of chip called an LPU (language processing unit), which it has claimed can run LLMs at 10 times faster and using one-tenth the energy. Groq’s CEO Jonathan Ross is known for this sort of innovation — when he worked for Google, he helped invent the TPU (tensor processing unit), a custom AI accelerator chip. In September, Groq raised $750 million at a $6.9 billion valuation. Its growth has been quick and significant — the company said that it powers the AI apps of more than 2 million developers, up from about 356,000 last year. Updated, 12/24/25 at 5:40 p.m. ET, with clarification from Nvidia about the nature of the deal.\n",

            "Запрос: ServiceNow to acquire cybersecurity startup Armis for $7.75B Enterprise software company ServiceNow agreed to acquire nine-year-old cybersecurity startup Armis for $7.75 billion in cash. The deal is a massive valuation jump for the company. Just last month, Armis raised a $435 million pre-IPO funding round, which valued the company at $6.1 billion. Armis co-founder and CEO Yevgeny Dibrov had told TechCrunch last month that the company aims to go public in late 2026 or 2027, adding that an IPO is his “personal dream.” Given the unpredictability of IPO markets and how few cybersecurity companies actually go public, it is not a surprise that Armis ultimately chose an M&A exit. According to ServiceNow, Armis has reached $340 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), with year-over-year growth exceeding 50%. Armis, which provides security software for critical infrastructure to Fortune 500 companies and governments, will help ServiceNow expand its cybersecurity offerings. The deal caps off a busy acquisition year for ServiceNow, which scooped up Moveworks for $2.85 billion and agreed to acquire cybersecurity startup Veza for $1 billion. According to PitchBook, Armis has raised a total of $1.45 billion in venture capital from investors, including Sequoia, CapitalG, and Insight Partners.\n",

            "Запрос: John Carreyrou and other authors bring new lawsuit against six major AI companies A group of writers, including Theranos whistleblower and “Bad Blood” author John Carreyrou, is filing a lawsuit against Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, Meta, xAI, and Perplexity, accusing the companies of training their models on pirated copies of their books. If this sounds familiar, it’s because another set of authors already filed a class action suit against Anthropic for these same acts of copyright infringement. In that case, the judge ruled that it was legal for Anthropic and similar AI companies to train on pirated copies of books, but that it was not legal to pirate the books in the first place. While eligible writers can receive about $3,000 from the $1.5 billion Anthropic settlement, some authors were dissatisfied with that resolution — it doesn’t hold AI companies accountable for the actual act of using stolen books to train their models, which generate billions of dollars in revenue. According to the new lawsuit, the plaintiffs say that the proposed Anthropic settlement “seems to serve [the AI companies], not creators.” “LLM companies should not be able to so easily extinguish thousands upon thousands of high-value claims at bargain-basement rates, eliding what should be the true cost of their massive willful infringement,” the lawsuit says.\n",

            "Запрос: This week on StrictlyVC Download, Connie Loizos spoke with Colin Angle, the founder and former CEO of iRobot. From his living room into a household name, Angle spent 30 years turning iRobot into one of the most pioneering companies in the robotics industry, stepping down as CEO following the failed Amazon acquisition. In this conversation, he unpacks why he considers iRobot’s bankruptcy “avoidable and a tragedy,” what regulators got catastrophically wrong in blocking the $1.7 billion Amazon deal, and why the FTC’s office walls covered with “blocked deals” as trophies revealed a deeply misguided approach to protecting innovation. Angle also shares the brutal reality of fighting regulators for 18 months while producing over 100,000 documents, why nascent American tech industries keep getting handed to overseas competitors, and what he’s building next with his stealth startup, including his contrarian take on humanoid robots and why Rodney Brooks is “never factually wrong, but not necessarily answering the question you think he’s answering.”\n",

While the real-life timing doesn’t exactly match these numbers, I saw charging times that came close to these figures. The advantage of this rapid charging is that you can always put your watch to charge when you are making a coffee or doing a quick chore within the house, and get enough juice to last you throughout the day.\n",

For the last 15 days, I started going to a gym, and apart from the treadmill and elliptical mode, there aren’t any specialized modes for particular gym equipment. Instead, you have to select from options for things like core training, weights, or a general workout mode, based on the workout you are doing.\n",

It also detects cardio workouts after 15 minutes of continuous activities, but while walking, these have been hit or miss for me. Another measure that has been off for me has been floor count. On days, I’ve walked to a cafe, I’ve seen a very high count for that, and on days I have gone up to my terrace multiple times, the number of floors climbed is incorrect.\n",

After a few weeks of usage, I regularly wore my watch to sleep. However, you don’t get additional or actionable insights related to sleep or readiness score on the watch in the daily summary. You do get suggestions on the Fitbit app related to readiness, but that’s about it. With fitness apps adding more AI to their apps, Google needs to step up its game.\n",

My one gripe is that I wish the exercise app allowed for more than three kinds of workouts to be available through quick start. I could raise my watch to talk to Gemini, which is neat, but beyond starting timers, asking for occasional sports updates, and starting a workout, I have not needed Gemini to be ever-present for me.\n",

        "russian_text = \"\"\"Была чудная ночь, такая ночь, которая разве только и может быть тогда, когда мы молоды, любезный читатель. Небо было такое звездное, такое светлое небо, что взглянув на него, невольно нужно было спросить себя неужели же могут жить под таким небом разные сердитые и капризные люди? Это тоже молодой вопрос, любезный читатель, очень молодой, но пошли его вам господь чаще на душу!.. Говоря о капризных и разных сердитых господах, я не мог не припомнить и своего благонравного поведения во весь этот день. С самого утра меня стала мучить какая-то удивительная тоска. Мне вдруг показалось, что меня, одинокого, все покидают и что все от меня отступаются. Оно, конечно, всякий вправе спросить: кто же эти все? потому что вот уже восемь лет, как я живу в Петербурге, и почти ни одного знакомства не умел завести Но к чему мне знакомства? Мне и без того знаком весь Петербург; вот почему мне и показалось, что меня все покидают, когда весь Петербург поднялся и вдруг уехал на дачу. Мне страшно стало оставаться одному, и целых три дня я бродил по городу в глубокой тоске, решительно не понимая, что со мной делается. Пойду ли на Невский, пойду ли в сад, брожу ли по набережной — ни одного лица из тех, кого привык встречать в том же месте, в известный час целый год. Они, конечно, не знают меня, да я-то их знаю. Я коротко их знаю; я почти изучил их физиономии — и любуюсь на них, когда они веселы, и хандрю, когда они затуманятся. Я почти свел дружбу с одним старичком, которого встречаю каждый божий день, в известный час, на Фонтанке. Физиономия такая важная, задумчивая; всё шепчет под нос и махает левой рукой, а в правой у него длинная сучковатая трость с золотым набалдашником. Даже он заметил меня и принимает во мне душевное участие. Случись, что я не буду в известный час на том же месте Фонтанки, я уверен, что на него нападет хандра. Вот отчего мы иногда чуть не кланяемся друг с другом, особенно когда оба в хорошем расположении духа. Намедни, когда мы не видались целые два дня и на третий день встретились, мы уже было и схватились за шляпы, да благо опомнились вовремя, опустили руки и с участием прошли друг подле друга. Мне тоже и дома знакомы. Когда я иду, каждый как будто забегает вперед меня на улицу, глядит на меня во все окна и чуть не говорит: «Здравствуйте; как ваше здоровье? и я, слава богу, здоров, а ко мне в мае месяце прибавят этаж». Или: «Как ваше здоровье? а меня завтра в починку». Или: «Я чуть не сгорел и притом испугался» и т. д. Из них у меня есть любимцы, есть короткие приятели; один из них намерен лечиться это лето у архитектора. Нарочно буду заходить каждый день, чтоб не залечили как-нибудь, сохрани его господи!.. Но никогда не забуду истории с одним прехорошеньким светло-розовым домиком. Это был такой миленький каменный домик, так приветливо смотрел на меня, так горделиво смотрел на своих неуклюжих соседей, что мое сердце радовалось, когда мне случалось проходить мимо. Вдруг, на прошлой неделе, я прохожу по улице и, как посмотрел на приятеля — слышу жалобный крик: «А меня красят в желтую краску!» Злодеи! варвары! они не пощадили ничего: ни колонн, ни карнизов, и мой приятель пожелтел, как канарейка. У меня чуть не разлилась желчь по этому случаю, и я еще до сих пор не в силах был повидаться с изуродованным моим бедняком, которого раскрасили под Цвет поднебесной империи.\n",
        "                Итак, вы понимаете, читатель, каким образом я знаком со всем Петербургом.\n",
        "                Я уже сказал, что меня целые три дня мучило беспокойство, покамест я догадался о причине его. И на улице мне было худо (того нет, этого нет, куда делся такой-то?) — да и дома я был сам не свой. Два вечера добивался я: чего недостает мне в моем углу? отчего так неловко было в нем оставаться? — и с недоумением осматривал я свои зеленые закоптелые стены, потолок, завешанный паутиной, которую с большим успехом разводила Матрена, пересматривал всю свою мебель, осматривал каждый стул, думая, не тут ли беда? (потому что коль у меня хоть один стул стоит не так, как вчера стоял, так я сам не свой) смотрел за окно, и всё понапрасну... нисколько не было легче! Я даже вздумал было призвать Матрену и тут же сделал ей отеческий выговор за паутину и вообще за неряшество; но она только посмотрела на меня в удивлении и пошла прочь, не ответив ни слова, так что паутина еще до сих пор благополучно висит на месте. Наконец я только сегодня поутру догадался, в чем дело. Э! да веды они от меня удирают на дачу! Простите за тривиальное словцо, но мне было не до высокого слога... потому что ведь всё, что только ни было в Петербурге, или переехало, или переезжало на дачу; потому что каждый почтенный господин солидной наружности, нанимавший извозчика, на глаза мои, тотчас же обращался в почтенного отца семейства, который после обыденных должностных занятий отправляется налегке в недра своей фамилии, на дачу потому что у каждого прохожего был теперь уже совершенно особый вид, который чуть-чуть не говорил всяком встречному: «Мы, господа, здесь только так, мимоходом, а вот через два часа мы уедем на дачу». Отворялось ли окно, по которому побарабанили сначала тоненькие, белые как сахар пальчики, и высовывалась головка хорошенькой девушки, подзывавшей разносчика с горшками цветов, — мне тотчас же, тут же представлялось, что эти цветы только так покупаются, то есть вовсе не для того, чтоб наслаждаться весной и цветами в душной городской квартире, а что вот очень скоро все переедут на дачу и цветы с собою увезут. Мало того, я уже сделал такие успех в своем новом, особенном роде открытий, что уже мог безошибочно, по одному виду, обозначить, на какой кто даче живет. Обитатели Каменного и Аптекарского островов или Петергофской дороги отличались изученным изяществом приемов, щегольскими летними костюмами и прекрасными экипажами, в которых они приехали в гор Жители Парголова и там, где подальше, с первого взгляда «внушали» своим благоразумием и солидностью; посетитель Крестовского острова отличался невозмутимо-веселым видом. Удавалось ли мне встретить длинную процессию ломовых извозчиков, лениво шедших с возжами в руках подле возов, нагруженных целыми горами всякой мебели, столов, стульев, диванов турецких и нетурецких и прочим домашним скарбом, на котором, сверх всего этого, зачастую восседала, на самой вершине воза, щедушная кухарка, берегущая барское добро как зеницу ока; смотрел ли я на тяжело нагруженные домашнею утварью лодки, скользившие по Неве иль Фонтанке, до Черной речки иль островов, — воза и лодки удесятерялись, усотерялись в глазах моих; казалось, всё поднялось и поехало, всё переселялось целыми караванами на дачу; казалось, весь Петербург грозил обратиться в пустыню, так что наконец мне стало стыдно, обидно и грустно: мне решительно некуда и незачем было ехать на дачу. Я готов был уйти с каждым возом, уехать с каждым господином почтенной наружности, нанимавшим извозчика; но ни один, решительно никто не пригласил меня; словно забыли меня, словно я для них был и в самом деле чужой!\n",
        "                Я ходил много и долго, так что уже совсем успел, по своему обыкновению; забыть, где я, как вдруг очутился у заставы. Вмиг мне стало весело, и я шагнул за шлагбаум, пошел между засеянных полей и лугов, не слышал усталости, но чувствовал только всем составом своим, что какое-то бремя спадает с души моей. Все проезжие смотрели на меня так приветливо, что решительно чуть не кланялись; все были так рады чему-то, все до одного курили сигары. И я был рад, как еще никогда со мной не случалось. Точно я вдруг очутился в Италии, — так сильно поразила природа меня, полубольного горожанина, чуть не задохнувшегося в городских стенах.\"\"\""

On days, I’ve walked to a cafes, I’ve seen a very high counts for that, and on days I have gone up to my terraces multiple times, the numbers of floors climbed is incorrect.\n",

With the Pixels Watches 4, I had to mentally train myself to keep the watches on so I could get a better understandings of sleeps and readinesses scores. After a few weeks of usages, I regularly wore my watches to sleep. However, you don’t get additional or actionable insights related to sleeps or readiness scores on the watches in the daily summaries. You do get suggestions on the Fitbits apps related to readinesses, but that’s about it. With fitnesses apps adding more AIS to their apps, Googles needs to step up its games.\n",

My one gripes is that I wish the exercises apps allowed for more than three kinds of workouts to be available through quick starts. I could raise my watches to talk to Geminis, which is neat, but beyond starting timers, asking for occasional sports updates, and starting a workouts, I have not needed Geminis to be ever-present for me.\n",

            "Была чудная ночи, такая ночи, которая разве только и может быть тогда, когда мы молоды, любезный читатели . небеса было такое звездное, такое светлое небеса, что взглянув на него, невольно нужно было спросить себя неужели же могут жить под таким небесами разные сердитые и капризные люди? Это тоже молодой вопросы, любезный читатели, очень молодой, но пошли его вам господь чаще на души! .. Говоря о капризных и разных сердитых господах, я не мог не припомнить и своего благонравного поведений во весь этот дни . С самого утр меня стала мучить какая-то удивительная тоска . Мне вдруг показалось, что меня, одинокого, все покидают и что все от меня отступаются . Оно, конечно, всякий вправе спросить: кто же эти все? потому что вот уже восемь лет, как я живу в петербургах, и почти ни одного знакомств не умел завести Но к чему мне знакомств? Мне и без того знаками весь петербурги; вот почему мне и показалось, что меня все покидают, когда весь петербурги поднялся и вдруг уехал на дачи . Мне страшно стало оставаться одному, и целых три дней я бродил по городам в глубокой тоске, решительно не понимая, что со мной делается . Пойду ли на невские, пойду ли в сады, брожу ли по набережных — ни одного лиц из тех, кого привык встречать в том же местах, в известный часы целый годы . Они, конечно, не знают меня, да я-то их знаю . Я коротко их знаю; я почти изучил их физиономии — и любуюсь на них, когда они веселы, и хандрю, когда они затуманятся . Я почти свел дружбы с одним старичками, которого встречаю каждый божий дни, в известный часы, на Фонтанке . физиономии такая важная, задумчивая; всё шепчет под носы и махает левой руками, а в правой у него длинная сучковатая трости с золотым набалдашниками . Даже он заметил меня и принимает во мне душевное участия . Случись, что я не буду в известный часы на том же местах Фонтанки, я уверен, что на него нападет хандра . Вот отчего мы иногда чуть не кланяемся друзья с друзьями, особенно когда оба в хорошем расположениях духов . Намедни, когда мы не видались целые два дней и на третий дни встретились, мы уже было и схватились за шляп, да блага опомнились вовремя, опустили руки и с участиями прошли друзья подле друзей . Мне тоже и домов знакомы . Когда я иду, каждый как будто забегает вперед меня на улицы, глядит на меня во все окон и чуть не говорит: « Здравствуйте; как ваше здоровья? и я, славы богам, здоров, а ко мне в мае месяцах прибавят этажи » . Или: « Как ваше здоровья? а меня завтра в починки » . Или: « Я чуть не сгорел и притом испугался » и т. д. Из них у меня есть любимцы, есть короткие приятели; один из них намерен лечиться это лето у архитекторов . Нарочно буду заходить каждый дни, чтоб не залечили как-нибудь, сохрани его господи! .. Но никогда не забуду историй с одним прехорошеньким светло-розовым домиками . Это был такой миленький каменный домики, так приветливо смотрел на меня, так горделиво смотрел на своих неуклюжих соседей, что мое сердца радовалось, когда мне случалось проходить мимо . Вдруг, на прошлой неделях, я прохожу по улицах и, как посмотрел на приятелей — слышу жалобный крики: « А меня красят в желтую краски! » Злодеи! варвар! они не пощадили ничего: ни колонн, ни карнизов, и мой приятели пожелтел, как канарейки . У меня чуть не разлилась жёлчи по этому случаям, и я еще до сих пор не в силах был повидаться с изуродованным моим бедняками, которого раскрасили под цвета поднебесной империй . Итак, вы понимаете, читатели, каким образами я знаками со всем петербургами . Я уже сказал, что меня целые три дней мучило беспокойства, покамест я догадался о причинам его . И на улицах мне было худа (того нет, этого нет, куда делся такой-то?) — да и домов я был сам не свой . Два вечеров добивался я: чего недостает мне в моем углах? отчего так неловко было в нем оставаться? — и с недоумениями осматривал я свои зеленые закоптелые стен, потолки, завешанный паутинами, которую с большим успехами разводила матрёны, пересматривал всю свою мебели, осматривал каждый стулы, думая, не тут ли беды? (потому что коль у меня хоть один стулы стоит не так, как вчера стоял, так я сам не свой) смотрел за окна, и всё понапрасну...нисколько не было легче! Я даже вздумал было призвать матрён и тут же сделал ей отеческий выговоры за паутины и вообще за неряшества; но она только посмотрела на меня в удивлениях и пошла прочь, не ответив ни слов, так что паутины еще до сих пор благополучно висит на местах . Наконец я только сегодня поутру догадался, в чем дела . Э! да вед они от меня удирают на дачи! Простите за тривиальное словца, но мне было не до высокого слогов...потому что ведь всё, что только ни было в петербургах, или переехало, или переезжало на дачи; потому что каждый почтенный господа солидной наружностям, нанимавший извозчиков, на глаза мои, тотчас же обращался в почтенного отцов семейств, который после обыденных должностных занятий отправляется налегке в недра своей фамилий, на дачи потому что у каждого прохожего был теперь уже совершенно особый виды, который чуть-чуть не говорил всяком встречным: « Мы, господа, здесь только так, мимоходом, а вот через два часов мы уедем на дачи » . Отворялось ли окна, по которому побарабанили сначала тоненькие, белые как сахара пальчики, и высовывалась головки хорошенькой девушки, подзывавшей разносчиков с горшками цветов, — мне тотчас же, тут же представлялось, что эти цветы только так покупаются, то есть вовсе не для того, чтоб наслаждаться вёснами и цветами в душной городской квартирах, а что вот очень скоро все переедут на дачи и цветы с собою увезут . Мало того, я уже сделал такие успехи в своем новом, особенном родах открытий, что уже мог безошибочно, по одному видах, обозначить, на какой кто дачах живет . Обитатели Каменного и Аптекарского островов или Петергофской дорог отличались изученным изяществами приемов, щегольскими летними костюмами и прекрасными экипажами, в которых они приехали в гор Жители парголовых и там, где подальше, с первого взглядов « внушали » своим благоразумиями и солидностями; посетители Крестовского островов отличался невозмутимо-веселым видами . Удавалось ли мне встретить длинную процессии ломовых извозчиков, лениво шедших с возжами в руках подле возов, нагруженных целыми горами всякой мебелей, столов, стульев, диванов турецких и нетурецких и прочим домашним скарбами, на котором, сверх всего этого, зачастую восседала, на самой вершинах возов, щедушная кухарки, берегущая барское добро как зеницы очей; смотрел ли я на тяжело нагруженные домашнею утварями лодки, скользившие по Неве иль Фонтанке, до Черной речек иль островов, — возов и лодки удесятерялись, усотерялись в глазах моих; казалось, всё поднялось и поехало, всё переселялось целыми караванами на дачи; казалось, весь петербурги грозил обратиться в пустыни, так что наконец мне стало стыдно, обидно и грустно: мне решительно некуда и незачем было ехать на дачи . Я готов был уйти с каждым возами, уехать с каждым господами почтенной наружностям, нанимавшим извозчиков; но ни один, решительно никто не пригласил меня; словно забыли меня, словно я для них был и в самом делах чужой! Я ходил много и долго, так что уже совсем успел, по своему обыкновениям; забыть, где я, как вдруг очутился у застав . Вмиг мне стало весело, и я шагнул за шлагбаумы, пошел между засеянных полей и лугов, не слышал усталостей, но чувствовал только всем составами своим, что какое-то бремена спадает с душ моей . Все проезжие смотрели на меня так приветливо, что решительно чуть не кланялись; все были так рад чему-то, все до одного курили сигары . И я был рад, как еще никогда со мной не случалось . Точно я вдруг очутился в Италии, — так сильно поразила природы меня, полубольного горожан, чуть не задохнувшегося в городских стенах.\n"

        "Ответ: При синтаксическом анализе сложных предложений возникает множество трудностей. Стоит отметить, что инструмент spaCy хоть и является весьма хорошим и акутальным инструментов в наше время, не очень хорошо справляется с работой выделения подлежащего и сказуемого, а также других частей предложения. Конечно же проблема является в том, что в русском языке подлежащим может быть любая часть речи, а также у этого подлежащего может быть множетсво сказуемых. Из-за этого нужно добавлять множество правил, чтобы взять все подлежащие и сказуемые и даже в этом случае собрать их всех остается довольно затруднительным. В английском языке все также довольно не легко. Существуют те же проблемы, что и в русском, но также при попытке вывести отношения в формате (субъект, предикат, объект), учитывать также предлоги и артикли очень трудно без дополнительных функций или условий."

        "LOCATION обычно берем предлоги которые часто употребляются с географическими названиями, однако, некоторые предлоги как например 'in' или 'at' используются также для других случаев, например: 'This is a major developement in AI'. Из-за чего ошибочно AI может стать географическим названием. Ошибки у spaCy заключаются в числах. Ему трудно определить если число является CARDINAL, ORDINAL или DATE. Например 2026 он отметил как CARDINAL, скорее всего потому что рядом не было слова 'year'. Также, Twitch он отметил вместо ORGANIZATION как PERSON. Частой ошибкой для SpaCy является ошибка границ сущности, например, Jyoti Bansal иногда выделяет полностью, а иногда просто Bansal или GPT-4o как 4o. Для подхода через правила характерной ошибкой является конфликты меток, LOCATION может быть на самом деле ORGANIZATION и наоборот. Например Snapchat определяется как ORGANIZATION, но, как я понимаю, из-за таких контекстов как '...at Snapchat...', иногда оно определяется как LOCATION.\n",
