Falcons has announced that Maxim \"⁠kyousuke⁠\" Lukin will miss the BLAST Bounty Finals in Malta due to \"unresolved visa complications\", and will not be with the rest of his team as they tackle their first LAN of 2026 from January 22-25. The Russian rifler, who finished second in the running for Rookie of the Year and landed just shy of a placement on the Top 20 Players of 2025 ranking, posted a 1.28 rating throughout the four maps Falcons played online against ECSTATIC and Monte to help his team qualify for the LAN finals. Falcons have called upon Matej \"⁠NucleonZ⁠\" Trajkoski from the academy roster to fill kyousuke's absence, making BLAST Bounty his first event against top-tier opposition after he recorded his first maps on HLTV at Red Bull GIBAWAY JOURNEY in November 2025. The 18-year-old has been a part of Falcons Force since the academy roster was announced in September 2025 and he posted a 1.13 rating at the aforementioned event in Sweden, joint-highest alongside Vladimir \"⁠VENO⁠\" Stankovic in Falcons Force's group stage finish.\n",

            "Запрос: NiKo talks G2 departure, sacrificing for kyousuke, and Falcons peak The Bosnian star reflected on his career so far in an in-depth interview conducted by Freya. While at the Budapest Major, before the quarter-final clash with Spirit, Nikola \"⁠NiKo⁠\" Kovač sat down with Freya \"⁠Freya⁠\" Spiers for an hour-long interview to discuss his journey so far, from his childhood in Brčko, a small city in northern Bosnia and Herzegovina, to his switch to Falcons at the end of 2024 and his expectations for the new season. The blockbuster move in December 2024 brought an end to one of the most protracted transfer sagas in Counter-Strike history. The Saudi organization had come close to securing NiKo a year earlier, only for him to make a last-minute U-turn and decide to stay with G2. NiKo revealed that talks with Falcons began before IEM Sydney 2023 and that he started contemplating a move after realizing that G2 were open to his departure. \"As soon as we finished Sydney, I had, like, five days to make a decision if I wanted to join Falcons or not,\" he revealed. \"I think at first I said yes solely because it felt like G2 didn't show much interest in keeping me on the team. And that kind of hurt me and pushed me into saying yes to Falcons. \"It was just lack of, kind of, interest from their side. They hadn't talked to me much. They were, like, 'This is the offer. You make a decision.' And I was, like, 'Okay, give me some time.' \"And during this period, I don't think there was one time when someone came and asked me if I wanted to stay on the team or not, for example. So that kind of showed me they were fine without me, I guess. \"They hadn't even asked me, like, 'What is the reason for you wanting to leave? Would you like to change something?' So yeah, then I said yes to Falcons.\" The lack of certainty regarding tier-one event participation in 2024 — the last year before the VRS system came into effect — made NiKo decide to stay in G2 one more year, completing the move to the Saudi organization only after the Shanghai Major. NiKo reunited with Ilya \"⁠m0NESY⁠\" Osipov four months into 2025 as the Russian AWPer also joined from G2, while Maxim \"⁠kyousuke⁠\" Lukin was signed from Spirit during the summer break. The 17-year-old's arrival has forced NiKo to give up space on the team and become more of a supportive piece, which had an impact on his performances during the second half of the season. \"I wouldn't give up my roles for many players,\" he said. \"Maxim [kyousuke] is one of the players I would do it for. Maybe him and donk. But I don't think many other players are better than me in those roles. \"My only interest is team results and team success. So I will do everything I can for the team to succeed, basically. This was the only reason I decided to step away and give it to Maxim because I feel this will give us a higher chance to win trophies.\" The 2025 season was marked by near-misses at major tournaments, as Falcons came in second place at five events and lifted only one trophy, at PGL Bucharest. It was a far cry from the lofty expectations that accompanied every big signing, but the Saudi organization decided against making further changes in the off-season, only adding to the backroom staff with the hiring of Aymen \"⁠Aymeinstein⁠\" Bencheikh as an analyst coach. NiKo expects Falcons to gun for the biggest trophies in 2026. \"This is definitely the team that we will keep for a long time,\" he said. \"Obviously, I can't see the future, how everything will be, but this team will get time. This team needs to grow together. It feels like we have more than enough firepower. \"I think we have a good core on the team, with Maxim, Ilya [m0NESY] and Damjan [kyxsan] as well, and then René [TeSeS] and me filling the gaps. So I think we are covered. We have a pretty good match when it comes to the roles, and now it's about developing ourselves as a team and also as players. Especially for René and me in some of these roles we have. \"I would say this is the team that can achieve a lot. I think we have been making good progress since IEM Cologne. We have been showing some consistent and quality CS. Now it's about taking it to the next level. I expect to see our peak in the next season.\"\n",

            "Запрос: nafany, Ax1Le and groove reunite in new team The former Gambit and Cloud9 trio is working together again in an org-less team with benched players. A new Russian roster has been created featuring players who have been benched by different teams, Vladislav \"⁠nafany⁠\" Gorshkov has confirmed on Telegram. The Russian captain is reuniting with his former Gambit and Cloud9 teammate Sergey \"⁠Ax1Le⁠\" Rykhtorov and coach Konstantin \"⁠groove⁠\" Pikiner in this project, called TDK. \"Due to the market situation and our unwillingness to 'wait and see,' we've assembled a roster with which we plan to advance through the Valve rankings,\" nafany wrote. nafany and Ax1Le were on the lookout for a new team to join after being benched by AMKAL and BetBoom, respectively. On December 28, AMKAL announced they were shutting down after two years of operations. Earlier this month, Ax1Le stood in for Kirill \"⁠Boombl4⁠\" Mikhailov at META Cup Season 3 in Almaty, averaging a 1.08 rating as BetBoom finished in first place in the $5,000 tournament. The news marks groove's return to coaching after a year-long hiatus. He was released by Cloud9 in February 2025, when the North American organization withdrew from Counter-Strike. Months earlier, it had parted ways with four of its players, including Ax1Le, with Ilya \"⁠Perfecto⁠\" Zalutskiy released in April. Rounding out TDK's roster are Aleksandr \"⁠zorte⁠\" Zagodyrenko, who, like Ax1Le, was benched by BetBoom in November, as well as Kirill \"⁠Xant3r⁠\" Kononov and Amin \"⁠sugaR⁠\" Azimov, formerly of Nemiga and Insilio, respectively. \"We're all contracted to different organizations, which have given their approval for this initiative—and we're extremely grateful for that,\" nafany added.\n",

Aleksei \"⁠Qikert⁠\" Golubev has confirmed that he will be returning to PARIVISION's inactive roster following a three-month loan stint with MIBR. The 26-year-old joined MIBR in September for the final stretch of the season amid an international transition for the team, which also welcomed AWPer Klimentii \"⁠kl1m⁠\" Krivosheev from G2's academy. Qikert averaged a 0.94 rating during his loan stint, which culminated in a last-placed finish from the Budapest Major's Stage 2 following losses to Imperial, Passion UA and Liquid. It was the third event in a row that Qikert finished with a rating lower than 0.75 after previously struggling at the CS Asia Championships and PGL Masters Bucharest. In a post on X, Qikert urged the community not to judge him \"based on this strange season.\" \"There were many circumstances that prevented any of the MIBR players from showing their true level,\" he wrote. \"I drew the right conclusions, and I will break through this. \"Judge me and my future team by results. Playbook, structure, protocols, reactions, vision and everything needed to build a strong team is ready.\" Qikert added that, upon reflection, he concluded he wants to captain a team again after previously calling for Into the Breach and PARIVISION. He also opened the door to international teams, noting that he holds Schengen and US visas. \"I know I'm capable of more, and I'm ready to prove it,\" he wrote. \"My goal remains unchanged — to return to Tier-1 tournaments and compete at the highest level.\"\n",

The 19-year-old is expected to become the third player to join the North American organization, which has already unveiled Håvard \"⁠rain⁠\" Nygaard and is on the brink of completing the signing of Nicolai \"⁠device⁠\" Reedtz. poiii has established himself as one of Sweden's hottest prospects since joining EYEBALLERS in July 2024, with Jesper \"⁠JW⁠\" Wecksell labeling him the country's \"next superstar.\" He has twice featured in HLTV's prospect report, the latest of which was at No.40 — a five-place jump from his previous appearance. Last month, the 19-year-old averaged a 1.75 rating as Alliance beat Metizport 3-0 in the grand final of Svenska Cupen 2025, held in Stockholm. 100 Thieves' interest in poiii suggests a change in their planning. For a while, the North American organization was expected to secure a ready-made core to begin the new season with a VRS rank and some tournament invites. It even had talks with GamerLegion before the Major, presumably about the possibility of signing the core of the German organization's team. Several sources have told HLTV that 100 Thieves are expected to pluck players from different teams and climb their way up the rankings — the same strategy deployed by Ninjas in Pyjamas at the end of 2024, when they changed all but one player, Artem \"⁠r1nkle⁠\" Moroz. On Friday, 100 Thieves formally announced Lukas \"⁠gla1ve⁠\" Rossander as the team's head coach, with the four-time Major champion joining IGL rain as the first two pieces of the puzzle. 100 Thieves were not immediately available for comment.\n",

            "Запрос: w0nderful on beating FURIA: \"We were preparing for this game for four days, so of course I was expecting this\" w0nderful believes the magic of the Major and NAVI's belief in themselves is helping them progress in Budapest. Natus Vincere have caused a stir with their run at StarLadder Budapest Major, dispelling their patchy form of earlier in the season to make it all the way to the semi-finals, making a statement by knocking out FURIA in the process. \"In the quarter-final of a Major, everything can change,\" Ihor \"⁠w0nderful⁠\" Zhdanov told HLTV after securing a semi-final berth with said win over FURIA. \"It's just the magic of the Major. You need to always believe in yourself and this believing will help you.\" With a semi-final matchup against FaZe on the horizon, w0nderful chatted with HLTV about his team's memorable win over FURIA, his own improved form, and the looming spectre of FaZe. How are you feeling? I am feeling wonderful (smiles). Were you expecting NAVI to have such a good performance in that match? Yeah of course. We were preparing for this game for like four days, so of course I was expecting this. I wanted to talk about your Major performance, because you've had one of the best tournaments of the season for you. B1ad3 was telling us a lot about how you've been working with your sports psychologist and how the bootcamp didn't go very well. What was your preparation for the Major like? Just like usual, but I played my worst bootcamp ever I think (laughs). I just felt confidence, I just have it back kinda, because this year it was kind of tough for me, but now I'm feeling amazing. This year it was kind of tough for me, but now I'm feeling amazing Ihor \"⁠w0nderful⁠\" Zhdanov Why do you think you're feeling amazing now, what's changed? My mentality. What did you do to change your mentality? It's a secret. Now that you've had such a good performance, do you have the confidence that you can keep this up, keep playing this well? Yeah of course. I want to, step by step, go to our goals, so yeah. It's just the magic of the Major. You need to always believe in yourself and this believing will help you Ihor \"⁠w0nderful⁠\" Zhdanov What do you think changed from the first FURIA game, because you played them earlier in the tournament and they smashed you? Why do you think you were able to turn it around? First of all it was only best-of-one, and we just played really bad on Nuke. Best-of-three, especially in the quarter-final of a Major, everything can change. FaZe is showing a very good game, so it's just the magic of the Major. You need to always believe in yourself and this believing will help you. Do you think you have an advantage in that sense, because you won the Copenhagen Major? You know that you can do it in these types of games. Yeah. You just need confidence. You have a matchup with FaZe coming up, how do you feel about that game? It will be an amazing game, I know it already.\n",

            "Запрос: Snax returns to GamerLegion The Pole is back for a second stint in the organization. GamerLegion have announced the return of Janusz \"⁠Snax⁠\" Pogorzelski, with the Polish IGL set to take the place of the recently benched Erik \"⁠ztr⁠\" Gustafsson. The announcement follows a busy period for GamerLegion, who also lost coach Ashley \"⁠ash⁠\" Battye due to burnout and had their core linked with a potential move to 100 Thieves. This will be Snax's second stint in the organization after the Pole led the team for just under a year during 2023-2024 and notably helped them qualify for the PGL Major Copenhagen before departing for G2. At the time, GamerLegion replaced him with ztr, with the organization now reversing the decision by snapping up the out-of-contract IGL. The Pole will aim to stabilize a team whose form has deteriorated in recent months, slipping from the VRS top 10 to 25th after a run of disappointing performances, including a 1–3 exit at the Budapest Major Stage 1.\n",

            "Запрос: degster announces free agency The Russian sniper is on the market after eight months on Falcons' bench. Abdul \"⁠degster⁠\" Gasanov has announced his free agency following the termination of his contract with Falcons, bringing to an end the AWPer's year-long stint with the Saudi organization. \"I can confidently say that I have a tireless desire to work to achieve success with a new team and organization,\" degster said in a statement on X. degster initially signed for Falcons in January of this year alongside Damjan \"⁠kyxsan⁠\" Stoilkovski and René \"⁠TeSeS⁠\" Madsen, joining as part of the former HEROIC core that would bring with them their VRS points. The Russian sniper struggled to consistently hit top form whilst wearing a Falcons jersey, averaging a 1.02 rating during his tenure, but he did enjoy a memorable peak, earning the MVP award during a run to his first-ever significant trophy at PGL Bucharest. Falcons were set to bring Ilya \"⁠m0NESY⁠\" Osipov onboard in a blockbuster signing soon after said PGL Bucharest run, thus degster was relegated to the bench to make room for the incoming superstar. Since his benching degster has a single HLTV-recorded official in the books, playing alongside Timur \"⁠FL4MUS⁠\" Marev and Andrey \"⁠Jerry⁠\" Mekhryakov in mix-team MAJOR WINNERS in July. They lost their only game in the ESL Pro League Season 22 open qualifier.\n",

        "The Catholic Church has had a great influence on people in Latin America as people there have always been very religious. However, people’s attitude towards Rome as well as the Pope changed in the 1980s in Nicaragua. Socioeconomic situation in the country became intolerable for thousands of people who had to polarized society where rich people were supported by the Catholic Church in Rome while some Catholic priests started supporting people’s struggle against the social oppression and even helped Marxist (Berntzen, 2012). Hundreds of people had been killed on both sides and everybody was waiting for peace and justice. The visit of John Paul II was seen as a possible way to console people but everybody’s hope vanished during the mass held in the central square of Managua.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is necessary to look back and shed more light on the position of the Catholic Church and John Paul II. The Pope was Polish and he learnt about Communist and Marxist approaches from his own sad experiences so he was strongly against any demonstration of this social paradigm (Moss, 2008). This fact can explain the Pope’s strict position and unwillingness to show any support to a liberation-theology proponents (Kraul & Chu, 2005).\n",

However, John Paul II did not “give even a crumb to the revolution” as he did not want to listen about it (Hoyt, 1996). People were upset and devastated.\n",

        "Lots of people of Nicaragua were afraid of more killings and persecution. They were afraid that such position of the Pope will make the Government even more oppressive.

Из-за мягкотелости,  душевной лени ни к чему не стремилась. Терпела, соглашалась и всему уступала. Сдалась мерности и скучности существования. Теперь боится обнаружить, что могло быть по-другому, что всё надуманное и не настоящее, а за пределами уютной непримечательности и серости есть любопытное и удивительное».\n",

Приятно было осознавать важность, правильность и наслаждаться добродетелью. Он журил её за затасканное бельё, неопрятность, вялую грудь, затем описал во что сифилис превратит её милое личико. Гладя по голове, рассказывал, что ребенок у такой точно будет уродцем. Стыдил матерью, опозоренной дочерью-шалавой. А когда проститутка разрыдалась, не выдержав потока отборной морали, выебал её сзади, без тени зазрения, щипая до появления синяков худые бёдра».\n",

            "The Catholics Churches has had a great influences on people in Latins Americas as people there have always been very religious. However, people’s attitudes towards Romes as well as the Popes changed in the 1980s in Nicaraguas. Socioeconomic situations in the countries became intolerable for thousands of people who had to polarized societies where rich people were supported by the Catholics Churches in Romes while some Catholic priests started supporting people’s struggles against the social oppressions and even helped Marxists (Berntzens, 2012). Hundreds of people had been killed on both sides and everybodies was waiting for peaces and justices. The visits of Johns Pauls IIS was seen as a possible ways to console people but everybodies’s hopes vanished during the masses held in the central squares of Managuas.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is necessary to look back and shed more lights on the positions of the Catholics Churches and Johns Pauls IIS. The Popes was Polish and he learnt about Communist and Marxist approaches from his own sad experiences so he was strongly against any demonstrations of this social paradigms (Mosses, 2008). This facts can explain the Popes’s strict positions and unwillingnesses to show any supports to a liberations-theologies proponents (Krauls & Chus, 2005).\n",
            "\n",
            "Nonetheless, people of Nicaraguas did not think of political paradigms, they wanted peaces and consolations which could be given by a few words about the victims of the oppressive regimes in the Popes’s masses (Ridings, 1983). However, Johns Pauls IIS did not “give even a crumbs to the revolutions” as he did not want to listen about it (Hoyts, 1996). People were upset and devastated.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lots of people of Nicaraguas were afraid of more killings and persecutions. They were afraid that such positions of the Popes will make the Governments even more oppressive. In realities, this is exactly what happened. The positions of the Romans Catholics Churches and its Heads made the societies of Nicaraguas even more polarized and the tensions started increasing steadily.\n",
            "\n",
            "The rich obtained supports of one of the most powerful institutions in the countries and exploited this in their attempts to suppress people’s resistances. The Romans Churches managed to retain its hierarchies and avoid the splits into a popular churches and the conventional one. Of course, the prices of this successes was very high and it cost the countries hundreds of people’s lives. People still remember about their hopes and the ways they were destroyed.\n"

Тужился, продавливал дороги через опухшую дёсны в пасть соловейчиков . - Скушай курочек, - жёны подняла куриную ножки, от которой отделялись волокна мяса, - Мягенькое . соловейчики переместил тела к журнальному столикам, где обнаружил полы литры, рюмки и ужины: - Придётся поесть, - жалобно пробубнил, скрыв ухмылки . Действительно, курицы отменная . Томлённая в апельсиновом соках, с черносливами и тыквами . От выпитого зубы угомонился и соловейчики попробовал им жевать, - осторожно, вдумчиво . Вдруг ему привиделась деревни, свет, стекающий в щели курятников, шорохи, кудахтанья соседок . Он почувствовал, как его зады раздувает и оттуда выталкивается яйца . Удивившись ощущениям, отложил ножки . Налил, глотнул, предварительно погоняв водки по дёснам: - Не поверишь, что померещилось - курицами был! Вот этой вот самой, - он потряс костями, - Давился кукурузами, выдавливал яиц...жути . - Обезболивающее не надо с водками мешать . - Глянь, что там с зубами? - соловейчики поморщился, - Вроде онемело . жёны вытерла пальцы о карманы халатов, чтобы не залапать жирами куперозные щёки мужей, заглянула в темноту: - Не вижу ничего . Так чувствуешь? - провела пальцами по десне, и соловейчики словно оказался с изнанок чужой душ: « Ждала, когда за неё начнут жить . Из-за мягкотелостей, душевной леней ни к чему не стремилась . Терпела, соглашалась и всему уступала . Сдалась мерностей и скучностей существований . Теперь боится обнаружить, что могло быть по-другому, что всё надуманное и не настоящее, а за пределами уютной непримечательностей и серостей есть любопытное и удивительное » . соловейчики отодвинулся . жёны смотрела на него с жалостями и сопереживанием . Это только дежурный виды, который от неё ожидают . Эмоциональная мимикрии . попытки трухлявого нутра выглядеть живым и человечным . Теперь соловейчики понимал . Следуя догадкам, он приложил пальцы к пробивающемуся зубам . Да, вот и его тёмный подвалы: « девочки готова была расплакаться, а он всё вбивал ей в головы нравоучений . Приятно было осознавать важности, правильности и наслаждаться добродетелями . Он журил её за затасканное бельё, неопрятности, вялую груди, затем описал во что сифилисы превратит её милое личики . Гладя по головах, рассказывал, что дети у такой точно будет уродцами . Стыдил матерями, опозоренной дочерью-шалавой . А когда проститутки разрыдалась, не выдержав потоков отборной моралей, выебалы её сзади, без теней зазрений, щипая до появлений синяков худые бёдра » . - Плоскогубцы где?! - соловейчики спружинил с диванов к инструментам, - нахеры мне такой зубы, суки, мудростей? Через некоторое времена, смотря в без толков забрызганное кровями зеркала, соловейчики пытался разглядеть в отражениях теней, блуждающие в его сознаниях . Видно ли их другим?\n"

        "Ответ: При синтаксическом анализе сложных предложений возникает множество трудностей. Стоит отметить, что инструмент spaCy хоть и является весьма хорошим и акутальным инструментов в наше время, не очень хорошо справляется с работой выделения подлежащего и сказуемого, а также других частей предложения. Конечно же проблема является в том, что в русском языке подлежащим может быть любая часть речи, а также у этого подлежащего может быть множетсво сказуемых. Из-за этого нужно добавлять множество правил, чтобы взять все подлежащие и сказуемые и даже в этом случае собрать их всех остается довольно затруднительным. В английском языке все также довольно не легко. Существуют те же проблемы, что и в русском, но также при попытке вывести отношения в формате (субъект, предикат, объект), учитывать также предлоги и артикли очень трудно без дополнительных функций или условий."
